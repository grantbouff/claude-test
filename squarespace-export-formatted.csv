104,Power in Weakness | One Verse Blog - Day 1,post,2017-10-10 21:02:00,One Verse,/blogfeed/2017/10/10/power-in-weakness-one-verse-blog-day-1,<p>Today’s blog is written by Jenn Buxton as she starts of our One Verse series of blogs.</p>,"<p><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br/><em>“But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.”</em> -2 Corinthians 12:9-10 (ESV)</p><p>Ever since we were born, society has told us that weakness is bad and inferior. That said, it can be easy to fall into a pit of self-pity or self-doubt when life gets hard. It’s easy to question ourselves – whether it be our abilities, our strengths, or our weaknesses. However, Jesus’ ministry is full of individuals who were seemingly weak, inferior, or disliked. Jesus took the least of these and used them to make an eternal impact for the kingdom.</p><p>In 2 Corinthians, Paul tells us that when we are weak God can show up and blow our minds. I think we see God’s strength the most in our lives when we are weak and have to fully rely on Him. I’m talking about those moments when you have nothing left to give and have nowhere else to turn except to God for guidance, wisdom, strength, and comfort. We stop relying on our own abilities, and start relying on our great and perfect heavenly father. When we do this, when we fully rely on God, He comes through in ways we could have never imagined or seen coming.</p><p>It is in these moments that we can look back and say, “Only God could have done that.” Through the mess, through the heartache, through the late nights and hard work – God showed up and outdid Himself!</p><p>Therefore, we should boast in our weakness! Whenever I start to feel stress or worry, I know that those feelings aren’t of God and that I need to lean more into Him, His word, and His promises – this promise in 2 Corinthians! Even though I am imperfect, weak, and have my flaws – He is perfect and He works through me. When we are weak, He is powerful in and through us.</p><p><strong>Reflection</strong><br/>Think about a hard time of your life that caused you to feel weak, stressed, worried, or like a failure. Did God redeem that time and show up in a big way? If you’re going through that hard time right now, are you able to see it as a time to let God in and lean on Him through the hardship? Are you able to boast when you are weak so that God can reveal Himself in a big way?</p><p><strong>Prayer<br/></strong>God, I am so thankful for who You are – that You are a perfect, powerful, loving God who always shows up even in my weakness! You make me better; You make me whole. Even though I go through hard times in this world, I trust that You are always for me and with me every step of the way. You are working out every detail in Your plan for my life and I trust in You! Help me to remember this even when life gets crazy. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554313266064-Q0EALE4DPFJFCNX2HLRW/Blog_black.jpg,156
157,Goodbye Old Me,post,2018-10-02 18:18:00,,/blogfeed/2018/10/2/goodbye-old-me,<p>Today’s blog is written by Niki Willis. Read as she shares how to walk as new creation and to surrender our ways to God’s when we deal with conflict. </p>,"<p>Today’s blog is written by Niki Willis. Read as she shares how to walk as new creation and to surrender our ways to God’s when we deal with conflict. <br/><br/><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br/><em>“Everything—and I do mean everything—connected with that old way of life has to go. It’s rotten through and through. Get rid of it! And then take an entirely new way of life—a God-fashioned life, a life renewed from the inside and working itself into your conduct as God accurately reproduces His character in you.”<br/>-Ephesians 4:22-24 MSG</em></p><p>So, you read the title—possibly intrigued, but pretty confident that you know what’s coming next. But do you really? In our current series, <em>My Way</em>, Pastor Gabe is teaching on conflict. I want to be upfront and honest and say that my biggest source of conflict, a majority of the time, is me. When my desires become more important than the needs of others, when I am offended because someone said something that struck a nerve deep down revealing something about myself and I become defensive, I find conflict. Do you see where I’m going with this? Can you see how I can be a source of conflict for myself? Ephesians 4:22-24 and I have become inseparable. I must choose to die to myself daily, and, just being real, it may be many times a day.<br/>You see, conflict means a state of opposition. It means to come into collision or disagreement—a controversy or argument. All the definitions mentioned are points of entry for the enemy when conflict is not handled God’s way. Because I live to serve Jesus, to model Him, and to know more of Him, I can’t afford cracks that allow the enemy to get into my heart and mind. So where does it start? Right with me! There will be conflict, but the key is to not allow conflict to have us. Throughout my life, I have tried fighting back. I tend to be a bit rebellious (I think), but that escalates and keeps the anger raging. When I tried to avoid the conflict, resentment began to fester in my mind and it became bigger than it actually was. Those tactics gave the enemy permission to whisper lies that were not there before! I say <em>thank you Jesus!</em> as I write to you now, this very second, I can boldly declare <em>goodbye old me!</em></p><p>So now you have the skinny on the old me. Well, a little of it. But let me tell you what Jesus is doing in me now! I practice, practice, and practice more of something that has changed me from the inside out. Here it is… You ready? <strong>Assuming the best in others and assuming the best in all situations.</strong>Sounds simple you might say to yourself, but it is not, look for the good! It is hard for the enemy to twist your perspective when you look for the good. </p><p>I ask the Holy Spirit to be the voice I hear the loudest. I ask Him to reveal to me when I am in “me” mode, so I can get out of my own line of fire. I ask Him to lead me to Him first, rather than running to someone I know that will jump on the bandwagon with me. I ask Him to place people in my life that can speak life into me, that can speak love and truth to me, that will keep me aligned vertically. I ask Him to help me to forgive because I know He forgave me. I want to view life from God’s perspective. I want His presence in my heart. I want more of Him and less of me. In order for that to happen for us, we have to say goodbye to the old US! I have by no means mastered this, but I do know that my goal in conflict is unity, and unity poses a threat to the enemy. We have to be in God’s Word to continue moving forward. We need to make the choice to surrender, surrender, surrender, and then surrender again—to say<em> goodbye </em>to the <em>old me</em>. </p><p>Think about this:<br/>We boldly declare these words to Him in our worship: <em>“If You gladly chose surrender so will I.”</em> But will you? Will you surrender your way, your right, and your wants when conflict arises? Will you own your part? Will you hear with an open heart? Loving people matters more than being right or being heard. </p><p><em>“Our love for others is our grateful response to the love God first demonstrated to us.”<br/>-1 John 4:19</em></p><p>Challenge:<br/>Pray Ephesians 4:22-24 over yourself, memorize Ephesians 4:22-24 and speak it over your life, time and time again. Say goodbye to the old you and hello to the new creation you are in Him!</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554313254887-X4SBRFODGCRPJ7MQPQ55/Blog_white.jpg,159
160,Conflict,post,2018-10-31 00:42:00,,/blogfeed/2018/10/30/conflict,<p>Today’s blog is written by Allison Poindexter.</p>,"<p>Today’s blog is written by Allison Poindexter.</p><p><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br/><em>“David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the Lord.” And Nathan said to David, “The Lord also has put away your sin; you shall not die. Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the Lord, the child who is born to you shall die.”<br/>-2 Samuel 12:13-14</em></p><p>When I was a child, I occasionally attended Sunday school with an aunt when I would stay overnight at her house. The trouble with attending Sunday school irregularly is that I got a somewhat irregular education about famed Bible characters. I remember learning about Bible characters like they were superheroes. I saw illustrations of Moses, staff in hand, standing before the parted Red Sea. I saw Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego huddled together with flames surrounding them but never hurting them. And I saw the child David, clutching a slingshot, ready to battle the terrifying Goliath. What I didn’t understand then was that the real superhero of these scenarios was God, protecting each of these characters from trouble. </p><p>The trouble with assigning superhero status to a character like David is that I ignored the most important part of his story.</p><p>King David’s life is rich with evidence of conflict. As a child, he defeated Goliath with just a stone, as I had seen in my Sunday school lesson. He endured the jealous, irrational King Saul to eventually become King of Israel. He fought countless battles to deliver nations into the hands of the nation of Israel. If we could put just those conflicts into a neat little box, David’s story would be one of triumph in the service of God. However, David’s story is much more complicated, and as a result, we are blessed with an example, a man after God’s own heart, who struggled with conflict and sin just like we do. </p><p>What we learn from David is that sometimes our conflict is really a conflict with and a sin against God. At the beginning of 2 Samuel 11, when the rest of Israel was at war, King David stayed in Jerusalem. While David was at home, he found himself in conflict. I’m not sure what caused David to even look upon Bathsheba, but the results were disastrous: adultery, betrayal, murder, and ultimately, infant death.</p><p>The Sunday school version of David certainly left out that this superhero warrior had committed adultery with a woman and killed her husband to cover it up. But I’m so grateful for the damaged, broken, and authentic David we read about in scripture, because when THAT David was confronted with his sins, he responded simply with “I have sinned against the Lord.” We have a record of the true David’s life and songs to forever provide wisdom as we encounter the conflicts in our lives, and the response we should give when we’re confronted with the ways we’ve sinned against God. We learn from David that our God is endlessly merciful and conflict does not disqualify us from a life of service to God.</p><p><strong>Reflection</strong><br/>Is there a conflict in your life that you need to repent of? What lesson can we take from David about how to repent?</p><p><strong>Prayer</strong><br/>Lord, I am so thankful for your mercy in light of my mistakes. Be with me so that I’m making choices that are honoring to you. I pray David’s prayer in Psalm 51: <em>“Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.” (Verse 10)</em></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554313174114-FUHOO0FTFSJBNSEAU3WH/Blog_red.jpg,161
162,Take a Look Inside,post,2018-10-08 18:16:00,,/blogfeed/2018/10/8/take-a-look-inside,<p>Today’s blog is written by Amber Parker on finding ourselves in conflict and taking a look inside.</p>,"<p>Have you ever been a part of a toxic environment? The kind that is full of fighting, gossip, anger, and backbiting? It could be a workplace, a team, or even your home. We have all experienced them. These types of places seem to pull people in and wrap them up in drama.</p><p>When we are surrounded by unhealthy behavior it is very easy to be sucked right into it. It is also easy to blame our own behavior on the situation, the environment, or the actions of others. This kind of thinking is exactly what James addresses when he writes to the early church. In chapter 4, James begins with this question, <em>“What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you?” </em>Then he gives an answer that probably surprised his readers, <em>“Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you? You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask. You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrongly, to spend it on your own passions.” -James 4:1-3 ESV</em></p><p>How do you react when you find yourself in the middle of negativity or conflict? Do you run away? Do you blame others? Do you blow up? Or do you solve it? </p><p>James makes it really clear, when you are involved in fighting and quarreling it is a reflection of what is going on inside you. In other words, you cannot blame the conflict on anyone else. If you are personally engaged in the fight, it is because you are personally unhealthy. It is much easier to find someone to blame, but our strong reactions, pointed words, and rude behavior are not present because of what someone else has done or said.</p><p>As a teenager, I remember hearing my pastor explain that our reactions are solely our responsibility. No one can provoke any behavior out of me that I am not in control of. He compared it to an orange. If you squeeze an orange what will come out? Only orange juice because that is what is already inside. When life “squeezes” you, or the people in your life “squeeze” you, that will only produce what is already inside of you.</p><p>In college, one of my jobs was in what I would consider a toxic environment. People didn’t trust each other, in fact, at one point the board fired the director. It seemed everyone had something to say and most of it was very negative. I found all too quickly I would get pulled into the talk about who said what and who did what. But in the middle of all of this, I remember one lady who stood out. She always had kinds words to say. I never heard her slander anyone or join in the chatter. To this day, anytime I think of positive speech, she is one of the first people that comes to mind. Despite the negative surroundings, she was able to remain positive and joyful. Why? I believe it was because her heart was right. Inside she was full of God so that is what overflowed from her life.</p><p>Next time you find yourself engrossed in conflict, take some time to check your heart. Use James 4 as a guide to ask a few questions, such as:<br/>● What is my motivation for engaging in this argument?<br/>● Why is this bothering me so much?<br/>● What unrealistic expectations do I have?<br/>● Why do I have so much to say about this?<br/>● What is it that I want to gain out of this situation?<br/>● Is there anything on my mind that I need to bring to God?<br/>● What is shaping my negative thinking?<br/>● What can I learn about myself through this?<br/>● How can I grow closer to God through this?</p><p>If you keep reading in James 4, James gives us some encouragement, <em>“[God] gives more grace. Therefore, it says, ‘God opposes the proud but gives to the humble.’ Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.” -James 4:6-7</em> When you find yourself involved in conflict don’t look around you. Instead, even though it might be painful, look inside your heart and look up to God for healing. When you do, you will find that God is full of grace. He will bring healing. And He will give you the strength to overcome.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554313900251-HHMIGYRMZ4C6QM5IRPPB/Blog_red.jpg,163
164,Food is My Love Language,post,2018-11-14 01:40:00,,/blogfeed/2018/11/13/food-is-my-love-language,<p>Today’s blog is written by JaVan Cook.

Read as she shares about how preparing and delivering meals are practical ways to communicate care and God’s love to our church family.</p><p><em>“I give you a new command: Love one another. Just as I have loved you, you are also to love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”<br/>–John 13:34-35</em></p><p>Food is my love language. Yes, I know it doesn’t make the list made popular by the famous book by Gary Chapman. We’ve all taken the assessments and should find ourselves in one of the five categories:</p><p>• Words of affirmation<br/>• Quality time<br/>• Receiving gifts<br/>• Acts of service<br/>• Physical touch</p><p>But for me, nothing I do compares to the overwhelming satisfaction I get when I cook for someone, have fellowship with friends, or plan our meals. Even grocery shopping makes me smile.</p><p>No matter what our cultural background is, the preparation and eating of food is something we all have in common with one another. And it is in the sharing of food with others that keeps us connected.</p><p>A quick biblical search on the topic of sharing food and hospitality will produce hundreds of verses. In some of the most memorable stories of Jesus, presented to us, we are reminded that he also saw the importance of these two things.</p><p><em>“Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.”<br/>-Revelation 3:20</em></p><p><em>“Share with God’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality.”<br/>-Romans 12:13</em></p><p>In the fast-paced, tech-saturated, attention-deficit-disordered culture in which we find ourselves, Christians need to recover the art of a slow meal around a table with people we care about. Can’t we all agree some of our best childhood memories include food? The Thanksgiving dinners when all of the extended family traveled to be together, those birthdays where mom cooked our favorite meal, or the summers spent gathered together in the backyard with the smell of the charcoal grill nearby. Food simply brings people together.</p><p>I am proud to serve on The Care Team at The Point, where we listen, pray and encourage everyone in our church family. I have been blessed with the task of chairing our “Meals Team”. Did you know that our church provides hot, home cooked meals to people in need, including new parents, and those recovering from surgeries or medical issues? We absolutely do! When I arrived at The Point, my first meal delivery was a simple one, Loaded Potato Soup and a sleeve of crackers. Seriously, I could make that with my eyes closed. But you know what? The recipient of that soup still to this day talks to me about our visit. Just last week as I walked out towards my car she shouted, “Hey, do I have to get sick again to get some more of that soup!” Food is my love language, and she’ll be getting a pot of soup from me very soon!</p><p><strong>Prayer</strong><br/>Thank You Lord for calling us into fellowship with Yourself and others. Thank you for your blessings of food, friends, and family. Help us to love one another as you have commanded and bless our time together always. Amen</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554312627865-E44RE6VWQJHMNPOQLKFE/Blog_white.jpg,165
166,Attitude of Gratitude,post,2018-11-20 01:39:00,,/blogfeed/2018/11/19/attitude-of-gratitude,<p>Today’s blog is written by Angela Shakelford. Read as she shares about the power of gratitude. </p>,"<p>Today’s blog is written by Angela Shakelford. Read as she shares about the power of gratitude. </p><p><em>“Come, let us sing for joy to the Lord; let us shout to the rock of our salvation. Let us come before him with thanksgiving and extol him with music and song.”<br/>-Psalm 95:1-2</em></p><p>Imagine the scene on Christmas morning. Everyone is gathered around the Christmas tree and the gifts are being distributed. There are two children present. The first child reacts with gratitude to everything they receive, even if they already have one or an item doesn’t quite fit right. The second child is difficult to please and nothing is quite right. There is a complaint, groan or face for everything received.</p><p>Which child enjoys Christmas most? The first child surely does because attitude makes all the difference – and this is true every day of the year, not just on Christmas morning. The Christmas morning example is like a snapshot of life. Some are thankful, and others continuously dwell on the negative. </p><p>When we are able to see life through a lens of gratitude, we are looking at it through the eyes of faith, trusting that God will see us through and provide. Renowned Bible teacher Chuck Swindoll says, “I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I react to it. And so, it is with you…we are in charge of our attitudes.”</p><p>It can become easy to slip into the trap of thinking or behaving like the second child at Christmas. The Bible teaches us through scripture over and over that we are to sing for joy and come before Him with Thanksgiving. On days when joy and thanksgiving is not my first reaction, no one can convict me of negative attitude more than Paul. He wrote from the confines of a prison cell, a lesson for us to “Give thanks in all circumstances.” -1 Thessalonians 5:18</p><p><strong>Reflection</strong><br/>Stop and think of 5 things in your life you are thankful for right now. Did it feel good? Could you keep going? How might it change your days to approach life with this attitude of gratitude?</p><p><strong>Prayer</strong><br/>Loving God, We turn our hearts to you, reminded that every gift we have was provided by you. For each gift, we are grateful. For each gift you have provided, we see the abundance of your love. We praise and rejoice in You. We give You thanks and praise.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554312615236-0TENAAUMRWRHUSV61YH1/Blog_red.jpg,167
168,Gratitude: The Pursuit,post,2018-11-27 01:25:00,,/blogfeed/2018/11/26/gratitude-the-pursuit,<p>Today’s blog is written by Jonathan Hickory. Read as he shares about how God pursues us as children and what it means to be a child of God. </p>,"<p>Today’s blog is written by Jonathan Hickory. Read as he shares about how God pursues us as children and what it means to be a child of God. <br/><br/>My beloved son turns two years old in a few days. Lately, he loves to play a game with me where he will run tirelessly through the endless grass in our backyard, looking back to see if I am running after him. He has no direction, he has no destination, but he knows he is running from me. To his delight, I pursue him, his little legs moving as fast as they can while my pace remains even, steady, and unwavering.</p><p>“Chase me, Daddy! Chase me!” he giggles with glee as his blonde hair reflects the warm sunlight. As he looks backwards, sometimes he stumbles and sometimes he tumbles, only to have me leap on top of him and sweep him up into my arms, embracing him with unsurpassable joy and endless love. We laugh together and I find myself overjoyed to share in his laughter and wonder. </p><p>How often do we, as children of God, run from our Heavenly Father? How often do we pursue worldly things—money, family, success, prideful ambitions, lust, greed, addictions—instead of pursuing our Creator? Though we do not realize it, as we pursue these things as a priority over our faith, we wander and we wonder, as God continues to lovingly pursue our hearts.</p><p>How can we begin to understand this pursuit? Why would God waste His time with a heart that is not only pursuing worldly meaninglessness, but often times running from Him at the same time? Let’s take a moment to explore God’s desire for His children. </p><p>You are created in God’s image — YOU are one of God’s children! <em>“God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.” -Genesis 1:27</em></p><p>Just as we love our children, God loves His children dearly and He desperately wants a close relationship with you. Jesus said, <em>“What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray? And if he finds it, truly, I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray. So it is not the will of my Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.” -Matthew 18:12-14</em></p><p>Our vulnerable young children trust their parents and they seek their father for protection from the dark and the dangers of the world — the nightmare, the vicious snarling dog, and crossing the busy street safely. God wants you to trust fully in Him and seek Him for protection from evil. <em>“The sun shall not strike you by day, nor the moon by night. The LORD will keep you from all evil; he will keep your life.” -Psalm 121:6-7</em></p><p>Our children rely on us for provision of food, clothing, and shelter. God wants you to trust in Him for provision; He will faithfully provide for you! Jesus said, <em>“Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.” -Matthew 10:29-31</em></p><p>Our children need and love their father, desiring relationship with him, just as you need Jesus in your heart in order to seek a genuine relationship with God. <em>“You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart.” -Jeremiah 29:13</em></p><p>Just as we want the very best for our children, yet know the value of discipline, God wants the very best for His children, and will lovingly discipline when needed. <em>“And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons? ‘My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved by him. For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives.’ It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live? For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness. For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it. -Hebrews 12:5-11</em></p><p>Have you ever thought about your relationship with God in this way? Your relationship with God is not a friendship, it is not a mutually beneficial business relationship, and it is not an arrangement where you get to call the shots — you are a child of our Sovereign God and you are created in His image. He is a good Father and He wants what is best for <strong>His children</strong> — that’s you and me! But a good and loving Father will also lovingly pursue and discipline the wayward child. </p><p><strong>Reflection</strong><br/>God’s pursuit of our hearts is something I am incredibly grateful for. If God had not pursued you, where would you be right now? Have you ever looked back on the hard times in your life, the times before you were walking with the Lord—and realized how He was chasing after you, yearning to sweep you into His arms and embrace you? Are you walking with God, and is He convicting your heart to draw you closer to Him? Or are you still running from Him? If you are not seeking God every day with every facet of your life, you better believe He is pursuing you. If you once were one of His lost sheep and the Good Shepherd found you, praise Him today and forevermore!</p><p><strong>Prayer</strong><br/>Almighty Father, You are our Good Father, and I am grateful for your pursuit of my heart. Lord, guide my path and help me to seek you first in all that I do, in all that I am. Thank you for loving me as your child, created in your holy image.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554312604329-H5XT308DNLULPRDLXWKJ/Blog_black.jpg,169

Read as she shares what to do when we are discouraged.<br/><br/><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br/><em>“For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction, that through perseverance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.”<br/>-Romans 15:4 – NASB</em></p><p>Have you ever been discouraged? Each of us has probably experienced some form of discouragement at one time or another; I certainly have. We’ve all felt sad, let down or disappointed, but true discouragement goes deeper than mere surface feelings. The dictionary defines discouragement as the loss of confidence or courage – to be disheartened. True discouragement is in many ways akin to a broken heart.</p><p>As Christ followers, we know that He dwells in our hearts, along with our own faith in Him, and hope, and love. And if the joy of the Lord is our strength, how could a child of God lose these precious gifts and give way to discouragement? Sometimes we forget, for a moment, that our powerful, loving, faithful God is with us and in us, and our eyes focus instead on our own issues that appear shrouded in hopelessness. We allow ourselves to believe that the moment or season we currently endure is our reality, and we turn inward, enduring it alone and believing the lie – tempted to give in to despair.</p><p>In my own life, such times might have overwhelmed me had it not been for the Word of God. He alone has the words of eternal life, and there is hope in Him. He heals the brokenhearted. His written Word is truth – our actual reality – and scripture is where we must always turn in our time of greatest need.</p><p>For as long as my season of discouragement lasts, God tells me through His Word that He is with me and will never leave me, and that waiting on Him brings strength. He assures me of ultimate victory because He is in me and has already won the battle and overcome the world. He reminds me that I am loved, cherished, and valued no matter how I might feel. He promises that when I turn to Him, He will turn to me – period. Indeed, the Word of God is my precious hiding place, my strong tower where I can run and be safe, the lamp that lights my path, the unshakeable truth that is forever settled in heaven; my teacher, my mirror, my constant companion, and my miracle of salvation. </p><p><strong>Reflection</strong><br/><em>“Remember the word to Thy servant, in which thou has made me hope.”<br/>-Psalm 119:49</em><br/>No matter what you may be going through today, God’s Word can help! Plunge yourself into that wonderful source of life-giving truth without delay and let hope and healing come into your heart. Know for sure, all that you are and all that you have in Him. Ponder these things, hide them in your heart, persevere, and you will know the meaning of “the encouragement of the scriptures!”</p><p><strong>Prayer</strong><br/>Dear Father, I am so very thankful for your Word, for its power and truth, and for the gifts and promises that are available to me there. Open my heart and mind and make me worthy to receive you, O Lord. Only say the word and I shall be healed.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554313143107-TSE7IG4UAAMKLX8UDP4D/Blog_black.jpg,171
172,15 Minutes to Flee,post,2018-12-10 17:07:00,REACH,/blogfeed/2018/12/19/15-minutes-to-flee,<p>Read from Pastor Gabe as he outlines our REACH partners and a brief picture of how we have been able to REACH these nations with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. </p>,"<p>Imagine sitting at home on a relaxing December evening before the warmth of your fireplace. It’s cold outside. You’re watching your favorite Christmas special. Your children are playing on the floor in the light of your Christmas tree. In the chaos of your life and the Christmas season, everything seems calm and right in the world, even if it’s just for that evening.</p><p>Suddenly the peace and quiet get interrupted with a phone call. It’s a warning that there is an army approaching your community and you have 15 minutes to flee. It’s a high likelihood that if you’re there when the army arrives, you and your sons will be tortured and killed, and your wife and daughters will be raped. What do you take with you? What gets left behind? </p><p>While it’s hard for us to imagine a scenario this tragic and disturbing, this is the reality of many Syrian and Iraqi refugees who were forced to leave their war-torn countries finding refuge in Jordan from both Isis and other fighting armies.</p><p>The week after Thanksgiving I had the opportunity to visit Jordan and specifically the region bordering the Syrian and Iraqi borders, where refugee camps are sprinkled throughout the desert side. As we were invited into the makeshift homes; tents with siding and roofs constructed of plastic tarps and sheets, we heard story after story like the one above. While these people once lived very comfortably, the only thing that they now possess is what they were able to gather and carry from their home in that 15-minute window.</p><p>We cannot change the circumstances of their past, but we can offer the hope and healing of Jesus for their future. We can provide blankets and heaters for their cold winter, food and other humanitarian aid in their hunger, and informal education for their children. And in sharing the love of Jesus in practical ways, thousands of these refugees are turning to Jesus and becoming followers of Him.</p><p>This is God’s redemptive story that we have been invited to be a part of in Jordan, Syria and Iraq. We have that same invitation in other nations of the world as well, and while not every country and need look the same, sharing the love of Jesus in practical ways is always the answer.</p><p>Below are our partners and a brief picture of how we have been able to REACH these nations with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Thank you for your generosity and your prayers which accelerate the vision God has given us. Please pray about going on one of our short-term mission trips and being the hands and feet of Jesus in the field.</p><p><strong>REACH Cuba – Go and Tell Ministries</strong><br/>Go and Tell Ministries is focused on reaching the people of Cuba through outreach, evangelism, discipleship, and humanitarian aid. The Point has an historic partnership with Go and Tell to build a ministry center in the community of Los Pinos, a suburb of Havana.  <br/>Over the past few years we have sent seven teams to assist in church and outreach ministry as they prepare to break ground on the ministry center in the near future.</p><p><strong>REACH Guatemala – Hope of Life </strong><br/>Hope of Life’s vision is to rescue the future generations of Guatemala and the world through the power of a practical gospel. Working with Hope of Life, The Point has completed the village transformation of Curva del Pino and has adopted the village of Timiluya, located in the mountains of Guatemala. Most people in Timiluya live in extreme poverty and make their living through agriculture. In 2018 we have completed much needed repairs on the school in this new village.</p><p><strong>REACH Liberia – Petals of Hope </strong><br/>Petals of Hope supports impoverished girls, families, and communities for Christ by creating opportunities for holistic education and establishing safe houses for victims of gender-based violence and trafficking. The Point partners with Petals of Hope through supporting and helping with the expansion of the girl’s academy. </p><p><strong>REACH Mexico – Seedtime and Harvest </strong><br/>Seedtime and Harvest is based on evangelizing the “lower end” of society – those who live as outcasts due to their addictions, cartel work, or abandonment by absent parents. These people are won through rehab centers, soccer programs, education programs, and social assistance. The Point partners with Seedtime and Harvest to support pastors, ministry leaders, and church planters. </p><p>In 2018 a team was able to take an exploration trip that helped with church expansion and we will be sending two teams in 2019. </p><p><strong>REACH Nicaragua – Feed My Lambs</strong><br/>Feed My Lambs seeks to meet the physical and spiritual needs of children in Nicaragua. They believe that the only way to break the cycle of poverty and bring change to the sense of hopelessness that exists amongst the poor is to start with the children and bring them into a relationship with Jesus—the one true hope for the world. The Point partners with Feed My Lambs to support children’s outreach and feeding programs. In 2018 a team was able to take an exploration trip and support children’s feeding and outreach. Our students at The Point will be focused on reaching this country and we will be sending a team of student in 2019.</p><p><strong>REACH Philippines – Aeta Bible Study Center</strong><br/>ABSC is focused on reaching the Aeta people who are the outcast of Filipino society. Most Aeta’s are denied education and medical care. The ministry’s vision is to teach the future generations of the Aeta people through the power of the practical gospel. The Point partners with ABSC to support pastors and plant churches in remote Aeta Villages. In 2018 we completed one church building and paid for feedings. In 2019 our teams will complete two more church buildings. </p><p><strong>REACH Togo – African Kids Evangelism Ministries </strong><br/>AKEM is focused on reaching the next generation of Togolese children with the transforming power of the gospel. The founding church is located outside of the capital city, Lome, and has established a school with over 1,000 children. They are also reaching out in northern Togo through church planting. The Point partners with AKEM through medical clinics and support for church planting. In 2018 an exploratory medical team visited Togo and in 2019 we will send a full medical team.</p><p>As we continue to pursue our vision of reaching 50 nations in our first 50 years as a church, we have chosen to partner with two US-based mission organizations: Advancing Native Missions and World Help. These amazing organizations help us in building all our international partnerships and in planning all of our trips. </p><p>To see upcoming trip dates and information, or to apply for a trip, visit: <a href=""http://thepointva.com/reachcountries"">thepointva.com/reachcountries</a></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554312584764-4M2CGGHMQ5HATS4T5PNJ/Blog_red.jpg,173

Read as she shares how we only find true satisfaction in God.</p>,"<p>Today’s blog is written by Hannah Critzer. Read as she shares how we only find true satisfaction in God.</p><p><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br/><em>“His soul shall be satisfied on Mount Ephraim and Gilead.”<br/>-Jeremiah 50:19 </em></p><p>“Our Spiritual appetite can only be satisfied with Jesus.” -Nicky Gumbel.</p><p>Would I be satisfied if I were to lose our Christmas holiday decorations, our lights, our presents, our food, even our Christmas parties if I were to just have Jesus? The scripture reference is from Jeremiah in which Jeremiah is trying to teach the readers the promises of God. One of the promises Jeremiah mentions is God wants the readers to be satisfied by the Lord alone. If we were to simply remember Jesus being born and the sacrifice it took our Heavenly Father to give Jesus to the world, would we still be satisfied? Satisfaction, or contentment at the core means being fulfilled. Nothing else needs to be added or given to be satisfied.</p><p>My husband and I have been married for a little over 3 years and at the beginning of our marriage I had this goal or drive to make every holiday, especially Christmas, be as festive as it could possibly be. We went to our local dollar store our first Christmas (newly married budgeters) and bought as much Christmas decorations and lights we could fit in our basket. We loved putting them up and decorating our first home together. That being said, I am for Christmas decorations and festivities but let me explain. I have found that the lights, the music, the decorations, even the food of Christmas time does not truly and deeply satisfy my soul. I am always looking for new decorations, and lights for our ever increasing Christmas holiday décor, or searching for the perfect gift that will get old within the year. Does it give me joy? Yes. Does it make me smile and want to bring my friends and family together for Christmas parties galore? Yes, and it still does. I am in no way, shape or form saying I am boycotting Christmas festivities and becoming the Grinch! This is more of a mindset than an actual tangible action. Christmas is a reminder to give my gaze and heart once again back unto the Father and let Him satisfy me apart from any materialistic item or experience. The simplest way I can think of doing that is reading His word and letting scripture melt onto our hearts so that we are reminded once again how much He loves us and wants us to be satisfied in Him. <em>“Look with wonder at the depth of the Father’s marvelous love that He has lavished on us!” (1 John 3:1b)</em></p><p>“The closer one comes to God; the more joy is experienced. Joy based not on circumstances or passing emotion but the joy of the Lord that comes from knowing Him”. -C.S. Lewis</p><p><strong>Prayer</strong><br/>Father, thank you for all the joys and beautiful festivities that Christmas brings. But more importantly than all the lights and sounds of the season, help me turn my heart and attention to Your heart right now and not get caught up in the commercialized hype. Help my true satisfaction be found in You and Your presence. Thank You, Father for sending your Son to us to be truly satisfied from the inside out.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554312506609-9X2Z9PQYMXNONY669BYC/Blog_black.jpg,175

Read as he shares how his family christmas traditions help him focus on the true meaning of Christmas.</p>,"<p>Today’s blog is written by Chris Eagle. Read as he shares how his family christmas traditions help him focus on the true meaning of Christmas.</p><p>Christmas traditions are something I think we all secretly wait for every year. For many of us, we seem to have some we remember from our childhood, and now maybe even cling to as adults. When I look back to my childhood and Christmas, now as an adult, I truly love the tradition of putting up the Christmas tree. For us, a real pine tree is not an option, our cats like to eat it! The picturesque pulling out of that fake Dillard from the box we store it in, is a thing of beauty! Of course, we always add some type of lights, only to find that one lightbulb that doesn’t work! Probably one of my favorite things is putting up our ornaments. They are from the places we’ve traveled, the things we enjoy, older ones I made as a child, to the ones we received from other family members. I love to think about what the ornament means and how it impacts me and my thoughts and my journey to that very moment in time putting it on the tree.</p><p>Amidst the Christmas music, boxes thrown everywhere, fake pine needles and fighting off the animals as they try and help decorate the tree, it is finally time to plug in the lights.</p><p>Boom! The lights come on! Woo! This spectacular moment signifies that the tree if finally finished, and it is the beginning of the Christmas season! Finally, I can stop being poked by fake pine branches. Now, the lights don’t just light up the tree, they also light up the room, the window it sits in front of, the yard out front, and can even be seen as folks drive down the road. For most, the lighting of the tree marks the beginning of the Christmas season. For me, the lighting of the Christmas tree represents the virgin birth of Jesus and the arrival of our Savior in the flesh. <em>Matthew 1:23 &amp; 25, “23 Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel (which means, God with us). 25 but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.”</em>Jesus brought a beaming light into our world, that bright light still shines today, much like the Christmas tree that shines bright all over our living room and out the window. John 8:12 says, <em>“Again, Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk into darkness but will have the light of life.”</em> I hope we continue to light up all of our trees as a reminder of the light Jesus brought into this world.</p><p>As we gather around our beautifully decorated, beaming Christmas tree on Christmas morning, my hope and prayer for everyone is that we remember the birth of our great King many years ago and the light He brings to change the world for eternity!</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554312497236-1AFRK9TCEFKDWNCR8SFS/Blog_white.jpg,177

Read as she shares with us how she chooses to rejoice in the hope Jesus brings even in seasons of darkness.</p><p><em>“When they saw the star, they were filled with joy!”<br/>-Matthew 2:10</em></p><p>When I was a little girl my parents allowed me to have a tiny tree in my bedroom. Picture a plump version of a Charlie Brown tree with bright white and multi-colored lights. The dazzling lights against the tinsel mesmerized me for weeks! The joy of the upcoming day was almost too much to contain. I felt like I was going to burst. I would belt out the verses of Jingle Bells and Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer along with the classic hymns of Silent Night and O Come All Ye Faithful as I caroled with my friends. </p><p>A lot has changed since then; my tree is much bigger, my life more complex, but the twinkle of the holiday lights and the sound of the music still sparks excitement in my heart. As Christians, we know Christmas is much more than holiday lights, tinsel, good music and shopping for the perfect gift. Christmas is a specific time to celebrate and rejoice because of the birth of our Savior and King, Jesus Christ. </p><p>In the book of Matthew, three wise men visit Jerusalem asking where they could find the new born king. They <em>“saw his star as it rose.” (Matthew 2:2)</em> Take a minute to think about his star. It had to twinkle and shine bright high in the sky. It guided their way to baby Jesus. I imagine they couldn’t contain their excitement seeing that light! A light in the sky shown bright for the light of the world to be born in darkness. </p><p>Darkness is something we all experience in our life on this Earth. This year, my family faced several life-threatening illnesses. My city and nation were scarred by hate and violence. Many families are without their loved ones this Christmas. I am reminded in all of this the Lord commands us to be joyful. The word rejoice is a verb, therefore it is something you do. We all know it is difficult to rejoice in pain, but Paul tells us in 2 Corinthians 6:10, <em>“sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything.”</em> He goes on to say in Philippians 4:4, <em>“Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!”</em></p><p>Jesus was born, rejoice! Jesus was born; rejoice in sadness. Jesus was born; rejoice in pain and hurt.</p><p><strong>Prayer</strong><br/>Father God – Thank you for the light of the world. May the light in our hearts never grow dim. I pray we faithfully choose each day to be joyful and rejoice in you always. </p><p><em>“I have come as a light to shine in this dark world, so that all who put their trust in me will no longer remain in the dark.”<br/>-John 12:46</em></p><p><em>“Exult in his holy name; rejoice, you who worship the Lord.”<br/>-1 Chronicles 16:10</em></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554312595319-VVJDX5V1OHZQKCZE9JB3/Blog_white.jpg,179

She shares her experience in the Philippines with her fellow teammates and how God is working and doing amazing things there!</em></p>","<p><em>Today’s blog is written by Brandi Kirby, who just came back from a REACH mission trip. She shares her experience in the Philippines with her fellow teammates and how God is working and doing amazing things there!</em> </p><p>At 38, I thought to myself, there has to be more to my walk with the Lord than leading a small group and serving at church on Sundays. I had a deep stirring in my heart to want more of Jesus, to know Him deeper and to serve Him greater. So, I took a step in faith and headed to the Philippines to serve with my church.</p><p>God showed me more on this trip. I gained brothers and sisters in Christ. I saw God’s greatness through instantly answered prayers. I learned to love deeper than I ever knew I could. I experienced love with no boundaries and I learned our ministry shouldn’t either. This mission trip changed my life.</p><p>We helped construct a church in a village that was a day’s walk from the main road – so thankful for our vehicle! There were so many children and adults and not many spoke English. We laughed, played and worked alongside them. One night, during our two nights stay, we shared the Jesus Film Project in their native language. I witnessed the power of praying in the name of the Lord in faith, and my request was answered instantly. There were wild dogs in the village that hadn’t bark during the video until the most important part. We paused the video where Jesus was lifted on the cross so the village pastor began to give a message, but we couldn’t hear because of the dogs. They barked like crazy as if they had a purpose, so I prayed fiercely. The dogs were silenced! I was later asked by one of my team members if I noticed what happened with the dogs because he was praying too! A few villagers were saved that evening.</p><p>A few days later, we took the film to another village. I witnessed many being saved that night. The movie was paused at the same moment, their pastor preached a powerful message – I heard and felt passion in his tone – then I experienced the most exhilarating feeling. I heard them repeating in unison a prayer in their language. I knew with every fiber of my heart what had just happened. We were told that MANY had accepted Christ into their hearts that night!</p><p>Throughout the week, we participated in worship that caused my heart to swell from the sweet children’s voices praising the Lord. We had devotional time and shared our testimonies of faith with children who were like sponges wanting to hear hope and gain wisdom. We connected despite the language barrier through love. Our team grew together through our serving, encouraging and sharing with each other. The last day of our trip a sister &amp; fellow teammate conquered her own internal battle. She shared her testimony for the very first time with the children of the school. She is no longer a slave to that fear which prevented her from declaring God’s victory in her life. We serve an awesome God!</p><p><em>Do you feel God stirring up your heart for more like Brandi?

213,Breakthrough to Freedom,post,2019-01-22 16:05:00,Women's Event,/blogfeed/2019/1/22/breakthrough-to-freedom,"<p>Today’s blog is written by Nicole Hawker about the Point’s women’s event, Breakthrough to Freedom</p>","<p>On February 16th we are having our annual Women’s Conference and I am so excited about this year’s theme…Breakthrough. We have been praying, planning and preparing for an incredible day. I want to encourage you to mark your calendars now and to register online for this power packed day of teaching, worship and hearing from the Lord. (<a href=""http://thepointva.com/breakthrough"">thepointva.com/breakthrough</a>). As women, we all need moments to slow down, reset, and spend time focused on self-care in the Lord. One of the ways I like to spend time with the Lord is through worship. Many times, God uses music to speak to my life situations and allows me to see how He wants to grow and develop my love for his guidance, direction and breakthrough.</p><p>Last year one of my favorite worship songs was “New Wine” by Brooke Ligertwood. She starts off with these words:</p><p><em>In the crushing, In the pressing, You are making new wine</em></p><p><em>In the soil I now surrender, You are breaking new ground</em></p><p>There is something that struck a chord in my heart to hear her sing of the crushing and pressing that creates new wine. And then she goes to sing about how new ground emerges when I surrender. </p><p>Last year I was in a season of wanting and feeling like I needed all of the details laid out in front of me if I were to survive that season. One year ago, the months began to snowball one right into the next. My mother became incredibly ill and passed away, and less than 30 days later my oldest son joined the Army. I felt like I could handle my mom’s passing because she was secure in her salvation and I had nothing to fear or be concerned about. She was at complete peace with her Jesus. My son, on the other hand, was embarking into unknown territory. I was not raised around the military, I didn’t have personal friends who were connected to the military, and I didn’t quite understand the role I would play as a military mom.</p><p>As the spring progressed and it was time for my son to leave for Basic Training, I was consumed with worry, fear, sadness, and at times Satan threw in a good dose of regret. I was not sure how I was going to get through 10 weeks of my son being transformed from a Civilian into a Soldier. If it were not for a group of strong Army Moms that I met online, I would have spent the remaining weeks in a pit of depression. God knew I needed a strong network of women who had walked this journey before me to help keep me focused. There came a point when one of the women reminded me to hold tight to my faith and to remember the promises God had already given me regarding my children.</p><p>Merriam-Webster Dictionary describes “breakthrough” as: <em>an offensive military assault that penetrates and carries beyond a defensive line; related to warfare. </em>When I think back to where I was last summer, I could have allowed Satan to win the battle in my mind. There were days when my peace was challenged, when my worship shifted to worry and back, when the focus of my joy was my situation. As I ponder this definition of breakthrough it leads me to believe that breakthrough occurs through–and as a result of–a series of events. For years, I believed that breakthroughs only occurred in an instant. For some people they do, and for others, breakthroughs can be a process. I have come to realize God is part of the progressive breakthrough as much as He is part of the instant breakthrough. Likewise, the making of new wine is not an overnight or instant process. The process of my breakthrough was not overnight. It took persistence to hold on to my peace. It took persistence to keep worship music playing in my car, when I was getting ready in the mornings, when I sat in my office at work, and even some nights when I had to have worship music playing while I slept to protect my sleeping hours.  I had to take an offensive stance against the spiritual warfare that was sent out against me.</p><p>My favorite song continues: <em>Where there is new wine, There is new power. There is new freedom.</em></p><p>When I think of new ground, I am also reminded of the many times God said in his word that He would give his children new territory, new land overflowing with milk, honey, and new wine. All this is a new season, a time in which God wants to do something brand new in our lives. This newness cannot be stuffed back into something that is old, used, and worn out. In Luke 5:37-38, Jesus says, “And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed, but new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.” </p><p>As I moved through the summer, I emerged with a greater sense of what it meant to be a Military Momma. I emerged with a greater awareness of the spiritual and physical battles that wage war on the women around me. I emerged with a greater awareness to pray for women near and far, some of whom I may never meet.  It has not been an easy journey. I continue to have moments where I become overwhelmed with wonder. There is a new sense of freedom that comes with this new season. I am free to trust God with my thoughts, plans, dreams, and desires. I don’t need to know all the details because God remains faithful and true to his Word. As I look back and compare those days to where I am now, I know without a shadow of doubt God is the God of My Breakthrough.</p><p>On February 16th, I invite you to join me and other women just like you for a one-day conference. There you will hear of God’s faithfulness in bringing about breakthroughs for women in Scripture as well as the women of The Point. We believe God has a special assignment for each of you as women in God’s Kingdom. He has equipped you and fashioned you for a purpose. He delights in you, and He wants to meet with you. Will you join us, worship with us, pray with us and simply lean in to listen to how God wants to propel you into your destiny?</p><p>Nicole Hawker</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554311676057-D7HLNAQV6ZF5U7P6PQU6/Breakthrough_Social2.jpg,214
215,Gaining Financial Peace,post,2018-08-20 18:24:00,,/blogfeed/2019/1/24/gaining-financial-peace,<p>Today’s blog is written by Jeff Pompeo who shares with us how important it is to be good stewards of what the Lord has given us!</p>,"<p>Today’s blog is written by Jeff Pompeo who shares with us how important it is to be good stewards of what the Lord has given us!</p><p><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br/><em>“I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it. 11 I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. 12 I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. 13 I can do all this through him who gives me strength. 14 Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles.”<br/>-Philippians 4:10-14</em></p><p>Paul wrote these words as he sat in a prison cell condemned for his faith, awaiting an uncertain fate. This section of his letter was basically a ‘thank you note’ to the Philippian church, which had sent him a financial gift. It’s interesting that Paul “rejoiced greatly” in gratitude for the gift, but at the same time, demonstrated peace in knowing that the Lord was fully sufficient for all of his needs, even while unjustly imprisoned. </p><p>Paul paints a beautiful picture of how we are to live our lives, being content in all circumstances. While it’s easy be content when we have good health, happy families, and large bank accounts, it’s more challenging to find contentment when we are struggling financially, physically, or emotionally. It’s important however, that we don’t confuse “contentment” with “complacency”. God wants us to find contentment in knowing that He loves and provides for us, but He is also clear that we must plan and work to improve our circumstances to avoid becoming complacent.</p><p>Jesus uses the example of building a tower to teach us the importance of evaluating our circumstances and creating a plan for success. Luke 14:28-30 reads, 28 “Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won’t you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it? 29 For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you, 30 saying, ‘This person began to build and wasn’t able to finish.’<br/>Jesus emphasized the importance of planning for the future as a way to achieve success; this concept applies to both our life and our finances. Having a plan is the key to success and the absence of a plan can quickly lead to complacency. </p><p>From a financial perspective, do you have a plan? Do you have a budget? Do you control your money or does your money control you? Regardless of whether you earn $1,000,000 per year or $1,000 per year, whether you’ve got debts you can’t pay or you’ve got a huge savings account, the only way to achieve contentment is by recognizing that everything belongs to God and we are simply stewards of his riches. Our job is to manage God’s money and resources for His honor while we’re here on this earth. The Bible gives us many specific methods for being good managers of money, and putting this biblical principle into practice starts with some simple budget planning.<br/>In Proverbs 16:9, Solomon wrote, “The heart of a man plans his way, but the Lord establishes his steps”. Everyone has hopes and dreams, but are you following the Lord’s instructional “steps”?</p><p>If you’d like to learn more about God’s plan for money management, which includes specific actions for reducing debt, increasing savings, creating a budget, becoming more generous, and establishing a plan for success, please consider joining the next Financial Peace class at The Point. Financial Peace is a 9-week course from Dave Ramsay that will meet Monday evenings starting September 17. We’ve presented this video-based class at the Point four times over the past two years, and the nearly 100 people who have attended the group have cumulatively increased their savings by over $81,000 and paid off over $65,000 of debt! To learn more, please visit <a href=""http://thepointva.com/groups/fpu/"">thepointva.com/groups/fpu/</a></p><p><strong>Reflection</strong><br/>Think about your current financial circumstances. Are you properly managing God’s money for His glory? Are you at peace with your financial plan or is money a point of stress in your life? Do you talk openly with your spouse or accountability partner about your financial plan or does money cause angst and arguments? Do you control your money or does your money control you? Proverbs 22:7 says that the borrower is slave to the lender… Do you have a plan for freeing yourself from the burden of debt? </p><p><strong>Prayer</strong><br/>Father, I am grateful for your living word, the Bible, which is my roadmap for life. I am thankful that you love me without bounds and provide me with all things. Please help me seek the contentment that Paul had, even from his prison cell, and help me create a plan to “build a tower” in my life. Help me to be a good steward of your kingdom on earth, and live a life that is pleasing to you.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554312486273-XZ3ANVR7K9X19EDY91I5/Blog_red.jpg,217
218,Pray First,post,2019-01-31 16:47:00,Pray First,/blogfeed/2019/1/31/pray-first,<p>Today’s blog is written by Pastor Gabe recapping the Pray First series and all the scriptures so you can continue to pray over yourself.</p>,"<p>It always means so much to hear what messages and message series have meant to our people, and never have we received as much feedback as we have with our Pray First series. This past Sunday we wrapped up this series, and if you weren’t able to be with us, or you missed a week or two, I want to encourage you to visit our website and catch up on the messages.</p><p>Many of you have requested a list of all the Scriptures that I referenced throughout this series. While these verses are some of the verses that I pray over myself each morning, there are many others that I did not share in the series. As you pray over yourself, the list below is a good starting point, but I would encourage you to search the Scriptures for yourself and ask God to give you specific verses in addition to these to use as a guide for prayer.</p><p>Here’s one last suggestion. After praying these verses over yourself each morning, carry the cards with you throughout the day and take 10 minutes over lunch, or while you’re waiting in line at the grocery store, or while you’re working out, and review the verses midday or later in the day as well. “With my lips I recount all the laws that come from your mouth.” –<strong>Psalm 119:13 (NIV)</strong></p><h3><strong>BODY</strong></h3><p>My son pay attention to what I say; listen closely to my words. Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart; for they (the words of God) are life to those who find them and health to a man’s whole body. <strong>Proverbs 4:20-22 (NIV)</strong></p><p>Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God—this is your spiritual act of worship. <strong>Romans 12:1 (NIV)</strong></p><h3><strong>MIND</strong></h3><p>Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will. <strong>Romans 12:2 (NIV)﻿</strong></p><p>We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ. <strong>2 Corinthians 10:5 (NIV)</strong></p><p>Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things. <strong>Philippians 4:8 (NIV)</strong></p><h3><strong>EYES</strong></h3><p>I made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a young woman. <strong>Job 31:1 (NIV)</strong></p><p>My son, give me your heart and let your eyes delight in my ways, for an adulterous woman is a deep pit, and a wayward wife is a narrow well. Like a bandit she lies in wait and multiplies the unfaithful among men. <strong>Proverbs 23:26-28 (NIV)</strong></p><h3><strong>EARS</strong></h3><p>Hear, Israel, and be careful to obey so that it may go well with you and that you may increase greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, promised you. Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. <strong>Deuteronomy 6:3-4 (NIV)</strong></p><p>So then, faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.  <strong>Romans 10:17(KJV)</strong></p><h3><strong>TONGUE</strong></h3><p>Reckless words pierce like a sword, but the tongue of the wise brings healing. <strong>Proverbs 12:18 (NIV)<br/><br/></strong>He who guards his mouth and his tongue keeps himself from calamity. <strong>Proverbs 21:23 (NIV)</strong></p><p>From the fruit of his mouth a man’s stomach is filled; with the harvest of his lips he is satisfied. The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit. <strong>Proverbs 18:20-21 (NIV)</strong></p><p>Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen. <strong>Ephesians 4:29 (NIV)</strong></p><p>When words are many, sin is not absent, but he who holds his tongue is wise. <strong>Proverbs 10:19 (NIV)</strong></p><h3><strong>HEART</strong></h3><p>Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it. <strong>Proverbs 4:23 (NIV)</strong></p><p>I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you. <strong>Psalm 119:11 (NIV)</strong></p><p>Your statutes are my heritage forever, they are the joy of my heart.<strong>  Psalm 119:111 (NIV)</strong></p><p>I desire to do your will, my God; your law is within my heart.<strong>  Psalm 40:8 (NIV)</strong></p><p>A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones. <strong>Proverbs 17:22 (NIV)</strong></p><h3><strong>HANDS</strong></h3><p>For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.<strong> Mark 10:45 (NIV)</strong></p><p>Now strengthen my hands.<strong> Nehemiah 6:9 (NIV)</strong></p><p>Do you see a man skilled at his work?  He will serve before kings; he will not serve before obscure men.<strong> Proverbs 22:29 (NIV)</strong></p><h3><strong>STOMACH</strong></h3><p>If you find honey, eat just enough, too much of it, and you will vomit.<strong> Proverbs 25:16 (NIV)</strong></p><p>It is not good to eat too much honey, nor is it honorable to seek one’s honor. Like a city whose walls are broken through is a man who lacks self-control. <strong>Proverbs 25:27-28 (NIV)</strong></p><h3><strong>FEET</strong></h3><p>And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”]<strong> Romans 10:15 (NIV)</strong></p><p>The steps of a man are established by the Lord, and He delights in his way<strong>. Psalm 37:23 (NASB)</strong></p><p>The man of integrity walks securely, but he who takes crooked paths will be found out.<strong> Proverbs 10:9 (NIV)</strong></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554311494553-7HPK6ZNNPXTJJP945N8N/Blog_white.jpg,219
220,Peace Be With You,post,2019-10-01 12:00:00,,/blogfeed/2019/10/1/peace-be-with-you,<p>Today’s blog is written by Krista Varanyak.</p>,"<p><strong>Today’s Reading</strong></p><p><em>“Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.”</em> <strong>Philippians 4:6-7 (NIV)</strong></p><p>Each year when the leaves fall and the seasons change, I enter a state of seasonal depression. The darkness of the autumn months fills me with dread and sorrow that feels never-ending. Maybe it is because some of the most difficult moments in my life happened in the fall, or maybe it’s the physical darkness in the sky each morning when I leave for work and in the evening when I get home. Nevertheless, every year, without fail, the fall season brings about a terrible anxiety that I cannot shake - until last year. </p><p>In Fall 2018, I began to learn more about prayer and decided to be more intentional with my prayer life. I started attending the prayer group at The Point with that intention in mind. Little did I know, God would use that group to absolutely transform my life. In one of the first meetings, I shared a prayer request for myself and my mental being during the upcoming months and was immediately prayer for by name. I continued to ask for this prayer and soon after, found comfort in the verses from Philippians 4:6-7 to pray over myself.</p><p>Through prayer, God intervened in a big way in my life last fall. Instead of being filled with anxiety and lies from the enemy, I was filled with God’s supernatural peace and surrounded by community. “Peace be with you,” is a phrase I am very familiar with from growing up in the Catholic church, but it never meant more than a simple greeting. I never understood what God’s peace truly looked like until I got to know Him through intimate prayer. His peace fills my body and mind, and overflows into others. Because I have His peace, I no longer feel dread for the new season coming, I am able to better serve my community, and I can face each day knowing I am guarded from the attacks of the enemy. </p><p>God does not want us to be burdened and weighed down by anxiety. Instead, He wants us to have a transformative relationship with Him that incorporates our gratitude and surrender to Him through prayer. </p><p><strong>Reflection</strong></p><p>What anxieties can you hand over to God right now? Ask God to show you the places in your life that need His guarding and the places that need His peace.</p><p><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p>Heavenly Father, thank you for desiring to know what is on my heart and carry it as your burden. Thank you for protecting my heart and filling me with indescribable peace, especially in the moments that seem so dark and hopeless. I pray that you remind me every day to show you gratitude for the comfort you provide.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1568641046362-WX0YTFDGAVE13R2OO286/blog_10.1.19.jpg,221
222,Jehovah Jireh,post,2019-10-15 12:00:00,REACH,/blogfeed/2019/10/15/jehovah-jireh,"<p>Today’s blog is written by Dawn Haasnoot, Mary Hannah Dolan, and Hannah Gall.</p>","<p>Written by: Dawn Haasnoot, Mary Hannah Dolan, and Hannah Gall </p><p>But He said to them, “You give them something to eat.” They said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish.” Luke 9:13a</p><p>This September, we (Dawn, Mary Hannah, and Hannah) set out with five other members of the Point to participate in medical missions in Togo. We didn’t really know what to expect, so we were prepared to do whatever the Lord called us to do. We were equipped with medicine, medical supplies, oral hygiene items, children’s toys, and anything else we could stuff into thirteen suitcases. </p><p>Our first day of clinic was at a remote village located about two hours north of Lome, the country’s capital. In the village’s church building, we set up a triage area, provider stations, and a pharmacy, anticipating we would see around 200-300 patients. We were quickly overwhelmed by the needs of the people we saw: worms, malaria, wounds, hypertension were a few of the many conditions we diagnosed. By the end of the day, villagers crowded in from all entrances of the church made clinic, hoping to be seen and examined by the physicians. We questioned how we would be able to meet the needs of all of the people in this village as well as our next two days of clinic. Yet, at the end of the day, we were able to treat over 400 patients and had enough supplies and medicine left over for our other two clinic days. </p><p>On our final day in Togo, we were able to participate in a Vacation Bible School for the children of AKEM. As we were unsure of our role in the VBS prior to our arrival in Togo, we had not prepared sufficiently. However, the Lord took the little we had to offer to the children (a short Bible skit and song), and multiplied it; the rest of the afternoon, we saw kids joyfully repeating the hand motions we had taught them about the creation story. We were also able to gift each child a pair of their very own underwear. The joy they expressed after receiving such a simple gift is unforgettable to us. Over 1000 kids heard the message of the Gospel that day. </p><p>This week in Togo challenged us to rely on God’s provision. We frequently experienced having “no more than five loaves and two fish.” Like the disciples in Luke 9, we had to trust in God to meet the needs of the people we were serving. Though we often felt we didn’t have enough to give, we repeatedly saw the Lord provide for each need.</p><p>Lord, thank you for being our Great Provider, Jehovah Jireh. Help us to rely on your promises, even when our circumstances seem overwhelming. Amen.  </p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1571060724489-FUEEUDM9ACD6PUYMOB7S/JehovahJireh_blog.jpg,223
224,How To Prepare for Battle,post,2019-10-22 12:00:00,Prayer,/blogfeed/2019/10/15/praying-a-miracle,<p>Today’s blog is written by Lynne Sade.</p>,"<p><em>“Make this your common practice: pray for each other so that you can live together whole and healed. The prayer of a person living right with God is something powerful to be reckoned with.”</em> <strong>James 5:16 (MSG)</strong><br/> <br/>The story of how my 23-year-old cousin Ben lived; it starts, in fact, five days before he died.  His mom, my Aunt Barbara, woke up on a Sunday morning this past April with a strong feeling she should fast that morning and pray instead of eating breakfast.  And on Monday morning, she felt the same way.  This feeling continued for four days, resulting in a water or black-tea-only fast until 10:30 each morning, at which point she would allow herself coffee with milk and food for breakfast.</p><p>On the fifth day, as Aunt Barbara was fasting, my cousin Ben was on a short morning jog about 30 minutes away, when his heart stopped, and he collapsed on the pavement.  His jogging route had taken him through future housing developments that were paused in their construction, where his body would have probably not been discovered for who knows who long, but thankfully when he collapsed he was in his neighborhood, and thankfully in the vicinity of a neighbor who found him on the sidewalk a few minutes later.  This neighbor just so happened to work in the hospital emergency room and was able to provide high quality CPR until the ambulance arrived, which it thankfully did shortly.  The medics were able to find a pulse after administering the fifth shock.  Upon arrival to the hospital, Ben’s girlfriend was a nurse working in the emergency department and thankfully was able to identify Ben as well as his medical history and current medications and dosages.  Despite the rain for which April is well known, the weather conditions were good enough for the helicopter to immediately transport him to Johns Hopkins, which somehow had a vacant bed in their small cardiac critical care unit staffed with doctors who happened to be well versed in Ben’s exact condition.</p><p>By the time Aunt Barbara broke her fast that day, God had already worked miracles beyond anyone’s wildest expectations.  Ben’s heart had stopped for 13 minutes, and by the grace of God it was miraculously working hard to beat again.</p><p>More miracles were needed for his body to recover from those 13 minutes, though.  The doctors at Johns Hopkins at first were hesitant he would survive.  After a day they were confident he would live but were hesitant about whether or not he would be brain dead for the rest of his life, or if he could breathe on his own or have functioning kidneys ever again. After another day they were confident he had some brain function but were hesitant about how much and how long it would take to get back to a semblance of quality of life.  After another day, they realized he had good brain function and would likely be able to leave the hospital within a year. The doctors reasoned that if things continued to progress, he would be stable enough for heart surgery within a few months.  The rate of his healing was so fast that he had surgery within a few days.  Ben’s healing confounded and mystified everyone as he walked out of the hospital one week after his body was found on the sidewalk.  There was no residual damage to any of his organs and no recommendations for any rehabilitation therapy.  He was healed.</p><p>Ben’s miraculous healing was inexplicable from a medical perspective, but not from a spiritual one.  I witnessed spiritual battle in Aunt Barbara like I had never seen anywhere else. I saw how she laid hands on Ben, fully prepared to go to war with the Enemy as she prayed dozens upon dozens of memorized Scripture verses over Ben’s body.  I watched how she declared victory over his circumstances.  I saw how she surrendered everything over to God, so that when Ben’s older sister arrived with a deep respiratory cough the third day he was at Johns Hopkins, Aunt Barbara didn’t  flinch about letting his sister by his bedside because she knew something as trivial as a cough was no match for the healing being done through Jesus.</p><p>The number of prayers being prayed over Ben would be an interesting exercise to attempt to calculate.  At his bedside with not much else to talk about, his siblings and I tried to figure it out at one point and reached around 1,500 people that we estimated we knew firsthand were praying for him.  That can’t possibly take into account the ripple effects of people we didn’t even know who had heard about Ben’s condition and felt called to pray.</p><p>Witnessing Ben’s miracle changed my life in so many ways, but for the sake of brevity for this blog post I’ll just say my biggest takeaway was that we have been given the blueprint for how to fight and win spiritual battles if we prepare ourselves and open our hearts to the Holy Spirit.  We never know when or how the Enemy will strike, but we do know there is a faithful God who can defeat the Enemy on our behalf if we are willing and able to call upon Him.  Aunt Barbara couldn’t have known what she would be up against that fifth morning she woke up and felt called to fast, but thanks to her willingness to obey God and a lifetime spent memorizing Scripture and developing a trust in God’s Word, she was prepared to fight a battle.  And God was so faithful as a result, showing again and again how mighty He is.  As Aunt Barbara put it afterwards, God is the same yesterday, today and forever.</p><p><em>Thank you God, for showing us that miracles happen every day and giving us the tools to fight our battles. Thank you for your steadfastness. Help us to trust your plan for our lives and spread the good news of your power and love.</em></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1569258708223-31BCWNDHKGEKNL08X2IU/BattleBlog_LynneSade_10-15-19.jpg,225
226,Value,post,2019-10-29 12:00:00,,/blogfeed/2019/10/22/value,<p>Today’s blog is written by Kristin Fields.</p>,"<p><strong>Value</strong></p><p><em>“For you know that God paid a ransom to save you from the empty life you inherited from your ancestors. And it was not paid with mere gold or silver, which lose their value. It was the precious blood of Christ, the sinless, spotless Lamb of God.”</em> (1 Peter 1:18-19 NLT)</p><p>Performance, possessions, and popularity – Does that sound like a miserable flashback to high school or what? If only that trio faded into ancient history like SAT scores. It seems though we have a natural tendency to believe these equate our value far into adulthood.  Even Jesus was tempted to prove himself in these key areas.</p><p>As we read the temptation of Jesus, we see he was first taunted to <em>“command these stones to become loaves of bread.”</em> (Matthew 4:3) Satan was prodding Jesus to prove himself. Ring a bell? Years ago, I met a famous preacher and the first thing she said to me was, “What do you do?” I don’t know why she asked that question. Perhaps, she was trying to make a connection, but her words twisted in my mind to imply that what I do equates my value. Thankfully, the Bible clearly states the tremendous value God gives every human life regardless of performance, including yours. Like Jesus, your worth is not rooted in your performance but God’s perspective of you.</p><p>Satan then offered Jesus <em>“all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.” </em>(Matt. 4:8) Evil still encourages the old lie that we are what we have. Ultimately, it’s a security issue. If we identify ourselves by any means other than the Word of God -our education, the size of our home, our position at work, our spouse, if we compare ourselves to others- we are using the inferior measuring stick of this world. Jesus refused culture’s definition of success and instead allowed his success to be defined by obedience to God. He was secure in knowing His Father and his inheritance as God’s child.</p><p>The pull of self-glorification also dangled before Jesus (v8). If Jesus received the enemy’s gift and worshipped him, he would not be reviled by people or nailed to a cross. Instead, all would have a good opinion of him resulting in immense praise and honor. As Satan offered the kingdoms of the world to Jesus, he was suggesting Jesus could bypass God’s plan and grab his glory ahead of time. We fight this temptation too, for instance, whenever we plan a response in conversation to positively shape what others think of us, or with a social media post where our self-image is bolstered with likes. Parents face glorifying themselves concerning their child’s abilities or where their student attends college. We must remember we are who God says we are, not what others think of us. </p><p>When we become enamored with performance, possessions, and popularity we are believing they add more value to our lives than what God has already declared. Today, live like Jesus – in the light of God’s deep affection, receiving the worth and value He has already placed on you, His beloved child.</p><p>Reflection:</p><p>Do you know what God thinks of you? Google search, “What does God think of me?” You’ll find many resources pointing to scripture that express God’s thoughts toward you.</p><p>Prayer:</p><p>Heavenly Father, thank You for setting Your love on me. Forgive me for seeking worth in anything outside of You. Please fill me with the light of Your truth and draw me deeper into Your love that I may know my true worth and value.  </p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1570023990042-NMMCTWRCU7OST6T47EN5/8.22.19_Blog_KristinFields_Value.jpg,227
228,Developing Patience,post,2019-10-08 12:03:00,,/blogfeed/2019/10/8/developing-patience,<p>Today’s blog is written by Tom Cappucci.</p>,"<p>Psalm 37:3-7a</p><p>Each year I select a word to be my focus and help me to grow in my faith.  Along with that word I search the scriptures to find a verse that speaks to my heart about the growth I sense God wants for me.  This year, I felt God was directing me to a word that most people are leery of asking for – patience.  To paraphrase an old saying:  If you pray for patience, God will present you with trials to give you an opportunity to develop patience.  And this year He has done just that.</p><p>As I searched the scriptures for the right verses to memorize and focus on, God lead me to Psalm 37, where He lays out a “formula” if you will with four steps to develop a heart and mind of patience.  </p><p>Step 1: Trust God:  <em>“Trust in the Lord, and do good; dwell in the land and befriend faithfulness.” v.3</em>  Our first step is to trust in God and seek to do His will – to be good and faithful in the place that He has us, knowing He will never leave or forsake us.  So we ask ourselves – Am I willing to truly trust that God has my best interest?   </p><p>Step 2: Delight in God:  <em>“Delight yourself in the LORD, and he will give you the desires of your heart.” v.4</em> When we know the Lord and delight in having fellowship with Him – reading His Word and being in a mindset of prayer – His heart’s desires become ours and we can rejoice in knowing and walking with our Lord. Question – What or whom do I delight in?</p><p>Step 3: Commit to God’s Ways:  <em>“Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him, and he will act. He will bring forth your righteousness as the light, and your justice as the noonday.” v.5-6</em> God’s ways – His commands – are good and trustworthy.  He takes action and directs our paths to make all things new and good for those that love Him and are committed to Him.  Question - Am I committed to God’s plan and not my own?</p><p>Step 4: Be Still:  <em>“Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him.” v.7a</em> When we trust, delight and commit to the Lord, we can find rest and enjoy God’s goodness.  When we truly do this, we can be patient and wait for God’s plan, in His perfect timing and for His glory, to be fulfilled.  Question – Am I willing to be still before God?</p><p>Prayer:  Lord, I love you and want to be completely in your will with whatever situation you bring into my life.  My desire is to trust you more.  To truly delight in what you are doing in my life.  To be fully committed to your ways.  Thank you Lord for your desire to continually shape me more into your image; to be more Christ-like.  May my heart, mind and soul be still before you as I wait patiently for your plan to unfold.  In Jesus’ name. Amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1569258127862-CBXZH0X989H4BCG51OTJ/blogpatience_tomcappucci_10-8-19.jpg,229
230,God’s Kindness in Refinement,post,2019-11-12 13:00:00,,/blogfeed/2019/11/12/gods-kindness-in-refinement,<p>Today’s blog is written by Sarah Whitney</p>,"<p><em>“Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.” – Ephesians 3:20 (TPT)</em></p><p>When we experience seasons of loss, financial burden, uncertainty or waiting, we may feel that God is more of a foe than a friend. Is God who He says He is? Or is He the God of the circumstances that I am experiencing? </p><p>I recently walked through a season where I questioned just that - ‘Is God always kind to me?’ I had a clear vision about what the next phase of my life should look like, but God didn’t reveal the fruit I was hoping for. My lens became focused on this direction, while God kept nudging me down a different path. In the fall of 2018, I joined The Point’s prayer group, which quickly became one of the biggest blessings of my life. While I continued to ask God to change my circumstance, He slowly but surely changed me. </p><p>Through individual and group prayer, He refined in me what it looks like to listen and walk with Him daily. I realized that there were so many areas where God was presenting manna where I never thought He would have. Multigenerational friendships, new service opportunities, a mission trip to Cuba– but most importantly, a deepened trust in Him to “do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us” (NIV 3:20). God gave me a genuine assurance in my soul to always be my Savior, my Advocate and my Provider.  </p><p>Paul wrote the letter to the Ephesians while he underwent imprisonment in Rome. His letter is filled with joyful truth, encouragement and unwavering faith despite his circumstance. What an incredible example of resting in God’s faithfulness! Instead of immediately filling the empty places in my heart with what I desired, God allowed the empty places to be seen. And that is one of the most kind and loving things He could ever do. </p><p><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p>Heavenly Father, I am thankful that You are always kind and know what we need. Help us to constantly fix our eyes on You. Remove any fear or doubt in our hearts and replace it with a steadfast understanding that Your ways are always good. Help us to lock Your truth and the gift of salvation in our hearts, regardless of our circumstance. In Jesus’ name, Amen. </p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1572272997073-4DMND4IHMU3IT9XH5895/11.12.19_SarahWhitney_GodsKindnessinRefinement.jpg,231
232,Being Built Together,post,2019-11-25 18:24:50,,/blogfeed/2019/11/25/being-built-together,<p>Today’s blog is written by James Burton.</p>,"<p><strong>Today’s Reading</strong></p><p>“Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God's people and also members of his household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit. (Ephesians 2:19-22 NIV)</p><p>This past October nine men went on a mission trip to San Pedro, Mexico. We partnered with Advancing Native Missions and built a two-story building in place of a 40-year-old structure that needed to be demolished and removed. This new building will house the children’s church and be a center to train missionaries that will spread the gospel of Jesus Christ throughout Central America. Beyond the building of this physical structure, we saw God moving to build us all individually and together in many powerful ways.</p><p>Our group was able to share our testimonies daily within a soccer program that is bringing the gospel of Jesus Christ to young men. Many of them have been impacted by the drug cartels, which have a large presence throughout this region of Mexico. We have been told that since we left, three of these young men chose to accept Jesus Christ as Lord and were baptized!</p><p>We saw so many examples of men reaching out, being vulnerable and receiving love and prayer. One man, Tomas, overheard a testimony and approached us. He shared that he was a recovering alcoholic that lost a brother to the cartels, was struggling with anxiety and needed prayer. God worked with us to build him up with prayer and encouragement. </p><p>Another young man David had divisions within his family and the family that his sister married into. He wanted to help us build but told us he was not interested in church. We worked side by side with David and later in the week he attended a church service. We also witnessed firsthand the unification with his new brother-in-law and his family. They went from trying to stop the wedding to preparing food together and serving it to us! </p><p>Another man Jonathon and his wife asked for prayer after a youth service. Two other men shared of personal needs after a men’s evening fellowship. God was working to edify this community as we shared His love, His Word and sought Him through prayer. The legacy of this experience is in a building we built but more importantly in the building up of the community and the growth that we each personally experienced as we served.</p><p><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p>Heavenly Father, I ask that You work in us to will and do of Your good pleasure. Help build us up as we work to build others up around us. May we have a heart of service. Fill us all to overflowing that we may be able to give and grow and love and serve Your people more and more, in the name of Jesus Christ.</p><p><br/></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1574705856479-NFPHX35C13O7585N7IWX/christopher-burns-8KfCR12oeUM-unsplash.jpg,233
234,Regarding Gratitude,post,2019-11-05 13:00:00,,/blogfeed/2019/11/5/regarding-gratitude,<p>Today’s blog is written by Melody Criswell.</p>,"<p>Zephaniah 3:17 <em>“The LORD your God is among you; He is mighty to save. He will rejoice over you with gladness; He will quiet you with His love; He will rejoice over you with singing.”</em></p><p>WOW.  God SINGS over us with JOY? </p><p>GRATITUDE is in all 66 books of the Bible, and it’s an almost overwhelming exercise in joy to study it!  Gratitude includes awe; praise; thankfulness; glory, joy, wonder, worship, exultation.  God made us in His Image, and we are hard-wired for gratitude just like we are hard-wired for worship; it is in our spiritual DNA.</p><p>Reading through the Bible… through all the troubles, sins, wars, and heartaches; EVEN SO, there is a golden thread from Genesis to Revelation, running through the whole sacred cloth!  ANYTHING repeated in so many different iterations, deserves attention. It greatly matters to God.</p><p>Gratitude shows up in Genesis 2:23, when Adam first saw Eve. If you dig into the original Hebrew and nuances, this short simple poem explodes with joy!</p><p>Judges, Job and Lamentations are perhaps the saddest books, but gratitude exists.  Ecclesiastes is SO somber, but still gratitude!  And Jude — that very dour, penultimate book — has it… Extremely tough times often cause extreme praise. Some of the most grateful books of the Bible are Psalms, Proverbs, Isaiah, and Jeremiah (“the weeping prophet”).  In the midst of all of the troubles in these books, the golden thread of gratitude runs through it all. </p><p>Hosea, Amos and Obadiah are notable for their LACK of gratitude, and God makes a very big deal about it…</p><p>The Gospels and the NT letters are overflowing with living waters of love and praise.  In fact, Philippians is “the happiest book of the Bible”, and Paul wrote it in JAIL.</p><p>The final book — Revelation: Glory, praise and ineffable joy are all over it, as God fulfills every promise starting in Genesis, and makes everything right!</p><p>So, what does that have to do with you and me, right now?  Everything.  Every generation has all the ups-and-downs of life.  GRATITUDE is a particular type of ATTITUDE, and that can flow out of us in ANY situation, through the rivers of living water of the Holy Spirit; any time we choose, despite circumstances.  GRATITUDE is RADICAL, COUNTERINTUITIVE, COUNTERCULTURAL, OVERWHELMING, and ALWAYS AVAILABLE.</p><p>We have the Word of God, from Genesis to Revelation, to assure us of this:</p><p>That after satan, the world and our own flesh have done everything that they are allowed to do…</p><p>After I have wrecked my life,</p><p>and maybe you have wrecked your life more than once</p><p>in every possible permutation</p><p>and just plain boneheaded scheme and idea;</p><p>after we have done our worst and called it our best:</p><p>It’s like God says, “You done yet?</p><p><strong>MY</strong> turn.”</p><p>God says, ""I will write the final Word on your life.</p><p>They've taken their best shot, and now it's MY TURN.</p><p>I will write the final Word on the final page in your life.</p><p>I AM the final Word on the final page of your life.”</p><p>And THAT is worth all my praise, for all eternity.  There are a quintillion other reasons for gratitude, but that one RIGHT THERE is everything. </p><p>Father, if You never did another thing for me, I would never be able to thank You enough for all that You have already done. And Father, it’s not that my life is that great. Except it is. It’s my little life, and it’s a great life! (Because everyone has a great life, <strong>IF</strong> they have You.) There are things I don’t have, but oh what I have… And I’m nobody special. Every one of us has a great life if we can see it through Your Eyes. If we have You, even on our worst days, we have EVERYTHING.  And that is beyond anything I could possibly deserve or comprehend. Thank You forever for loving me, before I even knew You.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1571663537660-KD1MJBN1WIISXAVDLJKI/MelodyC_11.5.19_RegardingGratitude.jpg,235
236,Looking for Joy,post,2019-12-10 14:00:00,,/blogfeed/2019/12/2/looking-for-joy,<p>Today’s blog is written by Katie Fisher.</p>,"<p>Scripture: Joy is gone from our hearts; our dancing has turned to mourning. Lamentations 5:15</p><p><br/>Is it really that bad? She was old. She lived a long life. She loved me. She didn’t suffer. She was only sick for 17 days.  All of those things make logical sense and yet I am still mourning. My 91-year-old mother passed away this past March after a 17 day illness. I always thought that if someone was old then it wasn’t a big deal to lose them. I have learned that it doesn’t work that way. Loss is loss. As I face this first Christmas without my mom and see how challenging it is, I am newly aware of all of the people I know who have lost loved ones in the past. Was I kind and considerate during their “firsts” for the next year or two? I am ashamed to say I don’t know that I was. I want to do better. I want to open my eyes and be considerate of anyone who is alone or facing challenges.</p><p>There is so much to be thankful for in remembering my mom. She truly did live a long life. She was blessed to only suffer a few weeks.  This isn’t everyone’s story. They may lose someone tragically in an instant or suffer with them for years before it is finally over. The Lord uses every challenge in my life and gives me the opportunity to grow better or to become bitter. There are few guarantees in life, but one is for certain, we will all experience loss. I don’t want to go through this season with a sad face and a heavy heart. My mother loved Christmas! I know that she would want me to carry on and continue to enjoy my life. I pray that I will open my eyes and see those who are going through a hard time. I want to be used by the Lord to offer a listening ear or do something with them or for them that will bring them joy. I am grateful for the legacy my mother left of caring and giving. </p><p></p><p>Prayer: </p><p>Lord, open my eyes to those who are hurting around me. Help me to show compassion and love. Thank you for the gift of Jesus. In Jesus name. Amen. </p><p><br/></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1575301076360-NVXVHWSJY8EBM34DCEEA/Untitled-3.jpg,237
238,Spirit-filled hearts in Cuba,post,2019-12-03 14:00:00,,/blogfeed/2019/12/2/spirit-filled-hearts-in-cuba,<p>Today’s blog is written by Dana Mares.</p>,"<p>“And the disciples were continually filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.” Acts 13:52</p><p>By Dana Mares<br/></p><p>God had been prompting me to go on a mission trip and when the opportunity came to go on an all-women trip to Cuba I knew that was the trip I was supposed to take.  I did not know what to expect, but I had a sense of anticipation for what God was going to do.  Of course, I had fears and anxieties as well but as I boarded our flight there was an overwhelming sense of God’s presence.  I was not alone, not just because there were also 10 fabulous women going along but because the Holy Spirit was right there with me. </p><p>Our time in Cuba was divided between serving in the local church and community and a women’s conference at a camp outside of Havana.  The theme for the conference was the Holy Spirit.  As a team we had been praying for months that God’s Spirit would show up in a mighty way during this time and wow… did He ever!  Through solid Biblical teaching we were challenged to go deeper in our walk with the Lord, to live in the overflow of the Spirit and not by our own efforts.  We saw God bring freedom and hope to many women as we shared personal testimonies.  We “raised an alleluia” in Spanish and English at the same time and reflected the glory of the Lord in the unity of believers.</p><p></p><p>“For the Lord is the Spirit, and wherever the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.  So all of us who have had that veil removed can see and reflect the glory of the Lord.  And the Lord – who is the Spirit- makes us more and more like Him as we are changed into His glorious image.”  2 Corinthians 3:17-18 (NLT)</p><p></p><p>In Cuba we found amazing beautiful people with hearts hungry for more of God. We found that worship has no language barriers.  We found a passion for the Lord that both inspired and challenged us.  We found that women have the same hurts and life experiences all over the world and that God is moving to bring healing and hope.  We found that prayer is a universal language.  And we found sisters in Christ that will forever be in our hearts.</p><p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p><p>These words from the conference theme song still play in my mind: “Holy Spirit You are welcome here”...  As the owner of a Bed &amp; Breakfast I understand the importance of being a welcoming host. I put out the best china and linens and I spend hours baking and preparing for my guests.  Why?  Because I want them to feel welcomed.  </p><p>How often do we put the same kind of effort into welcoming the Spirit to work in our lives?  Have we prepared our hearts?  Do we spend enough time in God’s Word and in prayer?  Are we thirsty for God?</p><p>Spirit-filled hearts don’t just happen, they come from an overflow of the Holy Spirit working in our lives as we seek Him daily. </p><p><strong>Prayer:</strong></p><p>Lord, we pray for more of Your Spirit in our lives.  We pray as David prayed in Psalm 63:1, “O God, you are my God; I earnestly search for you.  My soul thirsts for you; my whole body longs for you in this parched and weary land where there is no water.” Thank you that when we seek you, You allow yourself to be found.  Thank you that You are in the process of continually making us more like You.  Help us to be ever mindful of the Spirit’s presence in our lives.  We love You Lord.  Amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1575299942608-BE2Q7IBYNTQFEC6MHICR/cubablog.jpg,239
240,Getting Past the Words,post,2019-02-11 18:14:40,Pray First,/blogfeed/2019/2/11/getting-past-the-words,<p>Today’s blog is written by Leah O’Connell on prayer and things that can help when you don’t know what to say.</p>,"<p>My familiarity with prayer as a child was limited to something we recited at dinner, something we heard at church, what you did when someone was sick, and the closing activity before bedtime. As I got older, there were a few times that I found myself falling to my knees, my face bowed to the floor, coming to God - and I remember them vividly. Each time was out of desperation. I don’t remember the words, but the feeling of connection to my Father- <em>that</em> stuck with me. </p><p>Over time, I’ve realized that it’s never been the words that mattered to God. God is not concerned with how articulate we are, he’s concerned with our hearts. And the reason those desperate fall-to-my-knees moments are so etched in my heart are because they were turning points in my relationship with Him-- from knowing <em>about </em>Him to <em>knowing </em>Him.<em> </em></p><p>As Jesus sends out his disciples, preparing them for persecution in spreading the Gospel, he says, “do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say, for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour. For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.”</p><p>The Holy Spirit is powerful enough to know our prayers, our needs and the desires of our hearts, before we say a word, but the act of just coming humbly before God is what honors Him.  He desires our prayers because he desires relationship - it’s not a one way street. </p><p>Prayer isn’t about knowing all the answers. It’s about having communion with the one who does. </p><p>In Colossians 4:2, Paul reminds the people to “Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful.” To pray with an open heart is not being scared of “doing it right,” but to connect with our creator and allow Him space to be King of our lives in every emotion and circumstance. Yes, the desperate times, but also in gratefulness, joy, creativity, and <em>noticing</em> His hand in it all. </p><p><strong>A few things that help me when I don’t know what or how to pray : </strong></p><p>Reading scripture - I read a passage and pull out one verse that moves me, focusing on each word or phrase of it and praying from the overflow </p><p>Worship music - When I’m studying a song for Sunday mornings or just listening in my own time, sometimes I’ll rest on a particular lyric and pray over it. Saying a verse or lyric over and over again anchors something in my heart and I begin to pray from that truth. </p><p>Community - Building relationship with other believers who pray openly and boldly for one another has helped me see not only the power of prayer, but confidence in doing it, and given me new language to pray for issues or emotions.</p><p>Prayer: </p><p>Father, we praise you for knowing, understanding, and loving us even when we don’t have the words to express it. Help us to continue seeking you, that we would grow in relationship with you daily and hear your voice in new and powerful ways. </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554311429922-8PUXABNDYQHMT1PKPUWZ/Blog_black.jpg,241
242,Giving Fresh Meaning to the Lord’s Prayer,post,2019-02-18 14:00:00,Pray First,/blogfeed/2019/2/11/giving-fresh-meaning-to-the-lords-prayer,<p>Today’s blog is written by Allison Poindexter on a fresh look at the Lord’s prayer.</p>,"<p><em>“But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father in secret.  And your father who sees in secret will reward you. And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words.  Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.”</em> Matthew 6:5-8</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Giving Fresh Meaning to the Lord’s Prayer</strong></p><p>Before I knew the Lord, I was fascinated by the ritual of church: the hymns, the recited refrains, the scripture references in bold in my bulletin, the doxology, and the Lord’s prayer.  When I was very young, I would watch churchgoers lift their eyes from their bibles when the pastor asked them to begin reciting the Lord’s prayer - in the King James, of course! My eyes would scour the bulletin, looking for the words the congregation knew by heart.  It felt like I was left out of a special club because I couldn’t utter those words from memory, that my lack of “spirituality” would be like the words <em>faker</em> or <em>interloper</em> painted on my forehead.  It wasn’t until much later, when I finally heard a message about what the Lord’s prayer actually means, did these verses really capture my heart.  </p><p>The Lord’s prayer is a guide to some of the most powerful, authentic prayer I’ve ever uttered:</p><p><em>“Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.  Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.”  </em>God, you’re awesome.  You are holy, righteous, and so good.  You know much better than me, so please do what you want here on earth. </p><p><em>“Give us this day our daily bread.” </em>Lord, you are my provider.  You know me, my heart, and every thought that crosses my brain.  You know the things I think I need. But Lord, I ask you now to provide me with my actual needs.  The things I need to keep following you. </p><p><em>“And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.”  </em>Phew. This is a big one.  Lord, forgive me. Forgive me for the unkind thoughts I had about that lady at the grocery store.  Forgive me for the words I spoke in anger to my daughter. Forgive me for the patterns of thinking that keep me prisoner to sin.  Forgive me for not trusting you. Forgive me for not following you as you have commanded. <em> </em></p><p><em>“And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.”  </em>Father, protect me from my enemy, who lives, for when I’m weak, vulnerable, distracted, and powerless.  </p><p><em>“For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.”  </em>All of these things I ask, Lord, because You deserve my very best.  You are worthy of my very best.</p><p>Jesus gave us this prayer to combat artificial spirituality, to help us avoid empty phrases, to help us find words when we’re so broken we can’t find the words for ourselves.  I know that I’m so grateful to have a reminder of what to say when the right words are hard to find. </p><p><strong>Prayer: </strong>Lord, let my prayers, even when I don’t have the smartest, most spiritual words, be sweet to your ears.  Help me grow in my relationship with You through these words, authentic words uttered in private. </p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554311405268-4SZB22IZJU41OZ799AN2/Blog_white.jpg,243
244,Groups,post,2019-02-25 14:00:00,Groups,/blogfeed/2019/2/25/groups,<p>Today’s blog is written by Phillip &amp; April Meyer on their experience with Groups and how vital community is.</p>,"<p><strong>Today’s Reading</strong></p><p><em>“They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles. All the believers were together and had everything in common. Selling their possessions and goods they gave to anyone as they had need. Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.”</em> (Acts 2:42-47 NIV)</p><p>April and I began attending community group 18 years ago at a large church in Minnesota. Our desire was to meet people and build new friendships. God taught us that it is much more than just meeting people and there is great value to biblical fellowship. It is a great place to make friends, learn more about Christ and live life with other believers. Group is a place where you can walk through tough trials and people will rally around you. It’s a place where people will listen and pray for the things going on in your life. It is also a place to grow in humility, to serve others, and to love one another as we are called.  </p><p>One of our favorite ways to fellowship at group is by gathering around a table to share a meal. People relax and use the time to share about their family, hobbies, jobs, and other personal details. While breaking bread there is often laughter and time for telling stories. It allows everyone to get to know one another on a very personal level. </p><p>While discussing God’s word the relationships that are being built grow even deeper. When the Bible is at the center of the discussion, we gain the knowledge of God’s word. It is our source of encouragement or correction in those moments. Sharing experiences and examples of what God has taught or revealed to others, has helped us grow in applying those truths to our own lives.</p><p>In a world that is so far from God and people are feeling disconnected, groups provide a place where we can link arms, put our shields together and boldly go forward spreading the gospel. Groups allow us to encourage one another through the ups and downs of life. When one of the members needs help the group acts as a family. We have experienced this first hand through meals delivered to our family, prayers, watching our children, support through several deaths within our family, celebrating the births of both our children, and strong arms during several moves. </p><p><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p>Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for the gift of fellowship within groups. It is our prayer that everyone who attends The Point will join a group and experience your love through their church family. In Jesus’ name; amen</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554311396232-D55QFG7BENPNVOWAUCPU/Blog_red.jpg,245

And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” (<a href=""https://ebible.com/query?utf=8%25E2%259C%2593&amp;query=Philippians%25204%253A6-7&amp;translation=ESV&amp;redirect_iframe=https://www.allaboutprayer.org/bible.htm"">Philippians 4:6-7</a>).</p><p> “Be joyful always; pray continually; give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.” (<a href=""https://ebible.com/query?utf=8%25E2%259C%2593&amp;query=1%2520Thessalonians%25205%253A16-18&amp;translation=ESV&amp;redirect_iframe=https://www.allaboutprayer.org/bible.htm"">1 Thessalonians 5:16-18</a>). </p><p>How simple these verses make it sound to constantly be praying and giving thanks, yet how often do we feel like the world is crashing around us and we have nowhere to turn. </p><p>What does it even mean to pray <em>continually, </em>or <em>without ceasing</em>? Try thinking of it like keeping the line of communication open with God at all times. We might not be able to be on our knees in prayer 24-7-365, but we can keep our heart and mind open to hearing God in everything we do. We can also seek him first in our everyday decisions rather than last.</p><p><em> </em>Too often prayer becomes an afterthought, an option, or a last minute lifeline when we feel like everything else hasn’t worked. The Bible tell us that prayer is the opposite of these things. If we choose to put communication with God first and in everything we do, HIS PEACE will guard us. Wow, that sound like a much better option than trying to solve our problems, get frustrated, and then eventually turn to prayer. </p><p><strong>PRAYER TIPS:</strong></p><ol data-rte-list=""default""><li><p>Start everyday by giving thanks for all you have.</p></li><li><p>Ask God to speak to you throughout the day and keep the line of communication open with Him.</p></li><li><p>Commit to seeking him first in everything you do.</p></li></ol><p><strong>PRAYER:</strong></p><p>Dear God,</p><p>Thank you for all you have done in my life.

248,Just Hold A Baby?,post,2019-03-12 13:00:00,,/blogfeed/2019/3/12/just-hold-a-baby,<p>Today’s blog is written by Bonnie Russman.</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Verse</strong>:  <em>Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might. </em><strong>Ecc. 9:10a</strong></p><p>	As a mother of only one child – a daughter who has no children of her own – I confess to having an occasional case of “Grandma Envy”!  I have often longed to have a little one of my own to hold, kiss, care for and love, and have sometimes jealously watched my friends doting on their precious grandchildren, spending time with them, and talking enthusiastically about them as they share their photographs and stories.  While I can rejoice in their happiness and blessings, my own desires and disappointments are still there, lurking just beneath the surface of my emotions.</p><p>	Shortly after joining The Point, I remember vividly that one Sunday Pastor Gabe brought out a large fishing net onto the stage and invited several Point volunteers to come out and hold the net with him.  He encouraged each of us in the congregation to “Get your hands on the net” and find the right place to volunteer.  He mentioned several areas where there were needs, and began commending those who served in each area.  He ended his list of compliments with “And they’re rockin’ it out in Kids Point!”  I was thinking at the time that I would like to find some type of administrative or office work – something I was used to doing during the week at my job, and something I would enjoy.</p><p>	A year or so went by, and again one Sunday morning Pastor Gabe made an appeal for volunteers.  He discussed several opportunities, emphasizing that each one was important.  He said, “Even if you just hold a baby,” God can use you.  The Holy Spirit immediately tapped me on the shoulder, reminding me of my longing to have grandchildren in my life, and suggesting that Kids Point might just be the answer.  It was exciting to think that on Sunday mornings I could actually take care of, play with, and hold babies – what fun for a wannabe grandmother like me!</p><p>	God’s wisdom never ceases to amaze me.  I loved it, and before long I, too, was “rockin’ it out in Kids Point” with my precious little ones.  The ministry there is, of course, to provide these infants with a safe and nurturing environment, meeting their needs, and keeping them entertained, fed, changed, and hopefully happy.  But the parents of the children are also blessed.  It is because of the Kids Point volunteers they know they can attend the church service and focus on worshipping God without worry or distraction.  </p><p>	But for me, I’m the one who receives the greatest blessing of all just to have these children in my life on Sunday mornings.  For an hour or so I’m needed, my arms are filled, my spirit is delighted, and my heart is warmed and satisfied.  While I’m busy providing for the needs of others, the Lord is graciously meeting my own needs with love and joy.</p><p>	Jesus spoke these words in <strong>Matt. 25:40</strong>, <em>“Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.”</em>  Perhaps you are currently volunteering at The Point and feeling somewhat discouraged about the value of your contribution.  Please know that everything you do is needed and appreciated.  Every effort you make is pleasing to God.  And if someone asks you about your ministry, please don’t say, “I just direct traffic,” or “I just pour coffee,” or I just tear down, or “I just hold a baby.”  What you do is much more than that – so much more!</p><p><strong>Prayer</strong>:  <em>“O Lord, I thank you for placing me in a church where I am taught, nurtured, and inspired - a church where I am invited and encouraged to minister.  May everything I do, no matter what it might be, bring glory to your name and serve you, as well as my fellow believers.  I ask you to open my eyes to see the needs of others around me each day, and give me a servant’s heart that is filled with humility and compassion.  In Jesus’ name, Amen.”</em></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554310762201-41LBOT8U0FMZS64VW4QV/Blog_BonnieRussman.jpg,249
250,Love Without Borders,post,2019-03-19 13:00:00,REACH,/blogfeed/2019/3/19/love-without-borders,<p>Today’s Blog is written by Cody Bryant and his experience on his REACH trips.</p>,"<p><strong>Reading</strong></p><p>Dear friends, let us love one another, for loves comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.  <strong>1 John 4:7-8. (NIV)</strong></p><p><strong>Love</strong></p><p>This past January my team and I spent ten days serving the Aeta people of the Philippines. The Aeta are thought to be one of the earliest, if not the first, inhabitants of the Philippines living primarily in isolated, and mountainous regions of the island of Luzon. Despite their long history, the Aeta have faced devastating social and economic marginalization and displacement. During our time, we traveled to a village and spent three days building a church and living alongside the Aeta ministering, serving and “doing life” with them. After our extended time in this village we traveled to two other remote villages and were able to worship and feed more of the Aeta people. We concluded our trip by spending a few days on campus with our ministry partner the Aeta Bible Study Center (ABSC). ABSC’s mission is to educate upcoming generations of Aeta children, with the gospel at the cornerstone of their education. ABSC also trains pastors and plants churches in remote villages to further spread the good news of Jesus Christ across the Philippines. </p><p>During our time, love was resonating throughout the Filipino mountainside. Two groups of people from opposite sides of the world doing life together and loving on each other every step of the way. We ate together, we worked together, we laughed together, we cried together, we worshiped together. The Great Commandment (Mark 12:29-31) and the Great Commission (Matt 28:19-20) walked hand-in-hand. </p><p>1 John 4:7 first commands us to love. We must understand though that we do not love to <em>gain</em> His love but rather we love each other <em>because</em> He loves us. If we are truly born-again, we must be able to love one another. If verse 7 was not powerful enough, verse 8 should come as the ultimate reality check. If we cannot love, do we truly know God? Our knowledge and understanding of Him is manifested into our love for others. We cannot love without God because “God is love.”</p><p>We can use 1 John 4:7-8 to think of love as electricity. We are powered by God’s love flowing to us. That same power then flows out of us into the world around us. The circuit is then complete when that power is used to draw others closer to God. When the circuit loses power or the current weakens, then we know that we need to lean in deeper and closer to Him. Verse 17 of the same chapter goes on to read, “This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgement: In this world we are like Jesus.” If we are going to claim to be followers of God then His love must flow freely from within us. </p><p><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p>Father, thank you for your love for me. May I constantly be reminded of your steadfast love. I want to be a shining example of your unconditional love to all those around me. I want to live in such a way that those who do not know you but know me will come to know you because they know me. And may I be an encouragement to those who already know you and help strengthen their relationship with you. Amen.   </p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554310736211-VLRKL0HG3KEPOONJHIWI/CodyBryant_blog.jpg,251
252,A Heart For Serving,post,2019-04-02 13:00:00,Volunteering,/blogfeed/2019/3/26/a-heart-for-serving,<p>Today’s blog is written by Ashley Cordes.</p>,"<p><strong>Today’s Reading</strong></p><p>1 Samuel 12:24</p><p>“But be sure to fear the Lord and serve him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things he has done for you”. </p><p>We are called to serve. There is no way to debate that statement. In some way, shape or form, we are to serve in the ways that the Lord created us. I have been attending The Point for about three years when I took a bold step out of my comfort zone and said, “Here I am, Lord. Use me to serve you.” That was the breakthrough moment when I felt at home and experienced the fullness of Christ. I felt like I was thriving. I was not thriving because of anything I did, but rather what the Lord did through me. He clearly showed me how I needed to serve when I made that step of obedience. </p><p>Serving starts with the right mindset. One thing that I have learned during my time serving is the more I operate with the mindset of <em>everything I do is serving the Lord</em>, the more I find a complete and whole joy within myself and what I do. There have been times when I have had unenthusiastic thoughts about serving, but I am able to instantly discern that I am not operating with the mindset of Christ and in turn, change how I think. </p><p>After you have developed a Christ-centered mindset, you can then move on to finding and or using the gifts you have been blessed with in a service capacity. The wonderful thing is we are called to different things! We do not have to be good at everything to serve Him. Although there are many different ways to build up the body of Christ, serving others is so powerful because it allows us to physically see with our eyes the effect that it has on people. Serving is a reflection of Jesus’ love and in order to build up the body of Christ it is imperative that we love through serving one another. </p><p>Lastly, when the Lord births a calling in your heart, use it. If you think about it but never put it into action, then it is useless. The most genuine way to serve God on earth is to serve others. </p><p><strong>Reflection</strong></p><p>Think about a time in your life when someone served you. How did that make you feel? I encourage you to take the time to pray and seek out people in your life that you can serve.  Pray about how God wants to use you to serve Him for your good and His glory. Pray boldly. He will answer in amazing ways.</p><p><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p>Dear Lord, thank You so much for the spiritual gifts You have given to each of us. We ask that You give us the courage and the faith to use our gifts to serve You with an undivided heart. Lord, we ask that You help us not to be self seeking but to truly birth in us the unshakable desire to serve You for Your glory. We want to add to Your joy, Lord. We love You. Amen. </p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554310651911-CWPRW4187VH7TP8UGID9/HeartforServing_AshleyCordes.jpg,253
254,"Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow",post,2019-03-26 13:00:00,REACH,/blogfeed/2019/3/26/yesterday-today-and-tomorrow,<p>Today’s blog is written by Andrew Shackelford recapping The Point’s recent trip to Israel.</p>,"<p><strong>Today’s Reading:<em> “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today and forever.” </em>-Hebrews 13:8</strong></p><p>Over 60 people from The Point took a trip to Israel last month and my family was fortunate enough to be a part of it. This trip did many things for my faith, but the single greatest was how it opened my eyes that the land we read about in the Bible was not a fantasy or mythological Narnia but is a legit place. My eyes were opened that the Bible shows us the past, impacts my faith today and taught me what’s going to happen tomorrow.                                         </p><p><strong>Yesterday:</strong> I’ve read the Bible since I was in preschool, but I always thought of it as a story and not a real, physical place. In Israel, I got to stand next to a tree in the Garden of Gethsemane that was older than our country. It’s amazing to walk the path that Jesus used on the way to be crucified and think about the markets all around and people in the street watching. This was not how I pictured it or saw it in Veggie Tales cartoons as a kid. In Cesarea, standing where Paul was imprisoned and defended himself and seeing the surroundings taught me that Paul probably heard chariot races happening above his prison cell and this made the story come to life. The trip to Israel was like time traveling through the Bible and it opened my eyes to see the reality of the Word of God.</p><p><strong>Today:</strong> My eyes were opened to God’s love for me and my love for Him. One of my favorite parts of the trip was being baptized by Pastor Gabe in the Jordan River. Jesus got baptized in this very same place and it renewed my faith to have that experience. While the land is old, we worshiped and took communion the same way we do in Student Life and at the Point. One night, a couple dozen of us went out exploring the streets of Jerusalem. We came across a group of Korean tourists that were singing “How Great Thou Art” in their own language.  We started singing the chorus in English while they continued in Korean. There were two languages singing the same hymn in a land neither one of us lived in. We stood together praising God. Being in the Holy Land showed me that being a Christian and worshiping Jesus looks the same everywhere you go. </p><p><strong>Tomorrow: </strong>We often dream of what the future will look like. In Israel, it seemed more realistic when we stood where the book of Revelation tells us the gathering of armies for a battle during the end of times will happen. We saw the sealed Eastern Gate of Jerusalem’s old city wall and read about Jesus making his triumphal entry after he walks from the Mount of Olives. It opened my eyes to see the future and understand that the end of times is real, and we need to be prepared.</p><p><strong>Reflection: </strong>Think about your own faith. Many, many prophecies in the Bible have already been fulfilled. The things archeologist have found in Israel provide strength and evidence instead of just telling us to have faith. This gives us reason to have faith today and trust in tomorrow</p><p><strong>Prayer:</strong> God, thank you for showing us evidence of your existence. Help us to love and worship you no matter where we are. Please let us trust you with whatever tomorrow holds. </p><p></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554310700447-XQ420IE4ATPDA925EFCX/AndrewBlogpost_mar_26_2019.jpg,255
256,Carry Each Other's Burdens,post,2019-03-04 14:00:00,,/blogfeed/2019/3/4/carry-each-others-burdens,<p>Today’s blog is written by Claudia Ring on her experience and she’s learned what it means to carry each other’s burdens.</p>,"<p>Bear one another’s burdens.</p><p><em>“Bear one another’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.”</em>  Galatians 6:2</p><p><em> “We sent Timothy, who is our brother and co-worker in God’s service in spreading the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith.”</em>  I Thessalonians 3:2</p><p>So many of the “one another’s” of the Scripture like “bear one another’s burdens” are often lived out in small groups.  This is the place where we really get to know each other.  We are part of a growing, vibrant church where new people join us each week.   This is a blessing from God, but it also means that we can’t easily care for each other in the large body of Christ.  So just as Paul sent Timothy “to strengthen and encourage you in your faith” I Thess. 3:3, I have seen many “Timothys” carrying each other’s burdens in the women’s group I lead and the group I attend in the evening.</p><p>Over the past year and half, I have experienced brothers and sisters in Christ holding me up as my husband’s health gradually got  worse ending with him going to be with Jesus on December 2.  As he struggled through cancer surgery and infections and eventually congestive heart failure, I sometimes was overwhelmed with the physical caring for him and the emotional sadness of watching him struggle.  But God sent many from the two small groups to help carry the burden in various ways.</p><p>I have often asked the question “how can I help someone – how can I carry their burden.”  I now have a living example of that from these friends.  I knew they prayed for us – sometimes someone would send a text or email telling me of their prayers or writing a prayer they had prayed for us.  Phone calls, cards with notes of encouragement, many delicious meals while he was sick and also after he passed when I wasn’t ready to start cooking for myself.   I still have some in my freezer!  Gift of a journal with a verse on each page and notes from them to lift me up.  One shoveled snow, another brought muffins and came for a visit and invited me to go out for pizza with her.  Another helped in planning for the funeral and meals and offered to house an out of town friend.  I know that I can call on any of them for help when needed, whether to ask for prayer, to talk or for physical help.</p><p>God in His creativity gave others many ways to help carry my burden.  Now I will reach out and carry someone’s burden.  When you see someone in a hard time, ask God how you can help carry their burden.</p><p><strong>Prayer: </strong> Father, You have given me the body of Christ.  Help me to live out the “one anothers” of bearing someone’s burden.  Give me Your direction of what I can do to help.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554311385916-G8CC6JQL2HG5JS67LNAN/Blog_black.jpg,257
258,Perseverance,post,2019-04-16 13:00:00,,/blogfeed/2019/4/16/perseverance,<p>Today’s blog is written by Bonnie Russman on Perseverance.</p>,"<p>Scripture:	“<em>Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.</em>”  James 1:4</p><p><strong> </strong>While living in a small town in western Virginia, my next door neighbor was a lovely woman who held the title of Master Gardener.  Needless to say her plants and flowers were amazing and I always admired her gardening skills.  One summer evening she called me and said, “Bonnie, be in my back yard tonight at 9:00 pm.”  I couldn’t imagine what she wanted, but I was intrigued and just curious enough to comply.  When I arrived, she pointed out one of her large plants, and told me to keep my eyes on it.  As we both stood there watching, I was astonished to see, at precisely 9:00, a beautiful, perfectly formed, mature flower literally “pop” open right before our eyes!  The plant was an Evening Primrose, and I was delighted to watch as its other flowers also popped open one by one - I had never seen anything like it.</p><p>	Have you ever thought it be wonderful if we could find spiritual maturity in that way?  Just pop out and suddenly “be” the mighty woman or man of God that we desire to be, complete and perfect, ready to take on any task or trial with total confidence?  But you know, and I know, that this is not God’s plan for us.  His sanctifying work in us can be painstakingly slow, deliberate, and difficult, and He knows that we learn best through adversity.  It is through the act and art of living life with Him daily that we are <em>gradually</em> transformed into His likeness.  </p><p>	The Greek word for perseverance, <em>hupomone</em>, is also defined as <em>endurance</em> or patience – each closely linked in meaning, and each a crucial part of a mature believer’s faith.  But how do we learn perseverance?  Someone once said that if you ask God for boldness, you need to be bold!  Likewise, if you want to learn perseverance, you must persevere!</p><ul data-rte-list=""default""><li><p>Persevere through the Word.  Our enemies would love to destroy us, our faith and our future.  Recently I shared how years ago Satan actually sent the pastor of my small church to attack, accuse, and condemn me – shaking my faith to its very foundation.  I began to emotionally spiral downward until I questioned even God’s love and my own salvation.  After many tears and sleepless nights, I turned to His Word and rediscovered the TRUTH about myself and His great love for me.  I learned, and now “I know for sure” that I am saved, the Holy Spirit is within me, that Jesus loves me, and nothing can separate me from that love.  Are you struggling with your identity as a child of God and feeling somewhat lost?  Turn to His Holy Word – it is alive and powerful, a source of reassurance and hope, and eternal truth that will stand forever. </p></li><li><p>Persevere through Prayer.  I will admit that growing up as a young believer, prayer was never my strong suit.  It was difficult to make time to pray and to keep my focus on God whenever I did.  I’m learning, however, that there is no substitute for spending serious time with God.  Prevailing prayers, pleading prayers, heart-rending prayers, and brutally honest prayers are most pleasing to Him.  Prayer allows for intimacy with the Father, humbles us before Him and softens our hearts, it cleanses our souls and releases our spirits.  In the midst of our brokenness, prayer brings us back into a right relationship with God, it brings healing, and restores hope.  And, “Hallelujah, He’s a prayer-answering God!”</p></li><li><p>Persevere through Community.  Late last year I was diagnosed with an unusual and serious illness.  During the earliest days and weeks of the treatment I was given, I actually found it very difficult to pray, and sometimes impossible as I struggled with the physical challenges and emotional realities of my condition.  But praise God, my precious brothers and sisters in Christ rallied around me and prayed on my behalf!  They were such a tremendous blessing, especially as they prayed, but also as they cooked meals, sent cards, e-mails and texts, made phone calls and visited me in the hospital and at home – reaching out in love, compassion and concern.  This was a beautiful picture of community at work within the Body of Christ, humbling but heart-warming, God-ordained and real.  In community we help one another to persevere.</p></li></ul><p>Prayer:	Lord Jesus, you’ve told us in Your Word that “<em>The one who perseveres to the end shall be saved.</em>”  (Matt. 24:13)  We thank you for this assurance, for we do indeed long to see You face to face and to receive the crown of life you promised.  Until that day, help us to walk along the path set before us with endurance, patience, and faithfulness.  And should we ever be tempted to give up or stray away, may we echo the words of Peter in faith, “Lord, to whom shall we go?  You have the words of eternal life.”</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554737046959-8E52Z6ELC9S6DM4P0ZJO/4.16.19_BONNIERUSSMAN.jpg,259
260,Grace Upon Grace,post,2019-04-23 13:00:00,,/blogfeed/2019/4/23/grace-upon-grace,<p>Today’s blog is written by Jonathan Hickory. </p>,"<p>I have two cats. </p><p>Stanley, a sandy beige colored tomcat with a sweet and affectionate personality, was raised in our home lovingly since he was adopted as a very small kitten. Simon, a jet black, rambunctious, yet strikingly handsome fellow, was adopted as a young adult cat.</p><p>Stanley and Simon are always together, like two peas in a pod. When I go outside with my children on a beautiful sunny day, both cats come running up to get their due allowance of petting and human time. Stanley allows me to pet him and doesn’t seem to care when my children pull his tail or rub his fur the wrong way. </p><p>Simon, however, is a different story. I almost always get a glimpse of his unknown past-as he seeks attention and allows me to pet him, only to suddenly sink his teeth into my hand as I stroke his midnight black coat.</p><p>And while so many people would just refuse to have any contact with that seemingly spiteful and ungrateful cat, I continue to work with him. Over time, with love, Simon has improved with his trust and his behavior. While I know I may still get bitten, I know that Simon’s past is not something he can change, and so I choose to love him anyway.</p><p>How many of us have the same story? We have a past that is marked by brokenness and scars that we cannot change, and yet we still seek love from others. Others often see only our past when they look at us, and refuse to see the change in our hearts or the potential for change if we are shown love and a positive example.</p><p>Jesus loves us no matter what we have done or what our past looks like. If you ask Him to come into your heart and repent of your sins, He will, without question, create a new person while washing away the stains of your past. Trust Jesus with your life today, and He will bring the gift of True Love into your heart.</p><p>“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.”</p><p>Prayer:  Lord, please help me to love others despite the past they carry with them.  I know you love me, and have forgiven me, and that the old has passed away.  Let me be an example of your love and forgiveness as you show me grace upon grace.  Thank you for loving me Lord, despite my brokenness.</p>

262,Finding Hope in Stinky Circumstances,post,2019-04-30 13:00:00,,/blogfeed/2019/4/30/finding-hope-in-stinky-circumstances,<p>Today’s blog is written by Janice Cappucci about finding hope in stinky circumstances.</p>,"<p><strong><em>“Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and put on manure.”</em> –Luke 13:8</strong></p><p>When life is hard – when everything seems to be going wrong – how can we think about our circumstances in a way that protects us from being gripped by anxiety, bitterness, or hopeless despair? Consider the following fictional scenario: </p><p>Kate’s sweet and thoughtful daughter Akira has been invaded by the body snatchers. Or maybe just a wicked case of teenage hormones from the fiery nether regions. Akira’s constant put downs and outright contempt drag Kate into the pit of despair. Every night, she tosses and turns, wracked with anxiety over the state of the relationship. Every morning, she kicks herself, knowing today will <em>not</em> be the day she has enough energy to sign up for the volunteer project she’s been avoiding. </p><p>Is there anything Kate could be doing differently? For months now, she’s been begging God to change Akira’s heart, to no avail. “<em>Could it be, Lord, </em>she prayed<em>, that You are using Akira to change something in me??”</em></p><p>One day, in her quiet time, she came across a parable that confirmed her suspicions. </p><p>And he told this parable: “A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none. And he said to the vinedresser, ‘Look, for three years now I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and I find none. Cut it down. Why should it use up the ground?’</p><p><em>And he answered him, ‘Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and put on manure. Then if it should bear fruit next year, well and good; but if not, you can cut it down.’”</em> – Luke 13:6-9</p><p>Immediately Kate felt a prick in her conscience – first about the volunteer work she’d been avoiding, but also about how complacent she’d been in ‘seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness’. In the margins of her Bible she wrote, “The vinedresser was caring, patient and wise! He knew exactly what conditions were necessary to produce fruit. So, he put on manure. <em>He put on manure!” </em></p><p>As if with a new set of eyes, Kate thought about Akira’s hostility. <em>Before</em>, all she could see was piles and piles<em> </em>of manure. But <em>now </em>she saw God’s hand in it – his merciful hand, patiently working to help her grow and experience the joy of bearing fruit! “God <em>made</em> me to be fruitful,” Kate wrote in her prayer journal. “But my fruit won’t mature if I let it be choked by ‘life’s worries, riches and pleasures.’ Lord, please help me persevere and ‘produce a good crop’”  </p><p>Reflection: </p><p>What good fruit would grow in a garden without some high-quality fertilizer? What good fruit will God produce in us when we recognize His hand in stinky circumstances? </p><p>Prayer:</p><p>“Lord, please open my eyes to see your good purposes in hard times.” </p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1555344485596-N6MO9XE8IHG1PG67GLYP/4.30.19.jpg,263
264,Unforgiveness,post,2019-04-09 13:00:00,,/blogfeed/2019/4/9/unforgiveness,<p>Today’s blog is written by Debbie Fletcher on Unforgiveness.</p>,"<p><em>“Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other just as Christ forgave us.” </em> Ephesians 4:32</p><p>I want to share a little background.  My mom was an alcoholic and I grew up in a very dysfunctional family.  I was the oldest of 3 children and it was made known all through my life that I was an annoyance and inconvenience to her.  As I got older her only words to me were that of “I wasn’t good enough or lovable or couldn’t do anything right.”  I moved out as soon as I turned 18.  Several years later when Lee and I got married, we both came to know the Lord.  I knew this unforgiveness of my mom was not what God wanted for me, but I could not come to grips with the anger I felt toward my mom.  </p><p>My walk with the Lord was getting stronger and He was growing me, as I stepped out of my comfort zone in obedience to Him.  But I still had this unforgiveness toward my mom hanging over my head. About 5 years ago, I was so sick and tired of this cycle I was in and wanted so desperately to be free of my feelings of unforgiveness.  I got on my knees and prayed for God to take away every bad memory I had and soften my heart to accept my mom for who she was.  For me, it happened at once. I do know this is often times not the norm, it can be a process.  I no longer looked at her in the same way and did not have memories of the accounts of wrong doings she had committed against me. I had a list of all the hurts and could recite them in a moment’s notice, but I cannot recall that list even to this day. I felt a huge weight was lifted.  </p><p>We never had a close relationship, but the last 5 years of her life was comfortable when we were together.  I am thankful for God’s grace to me and allowing me to see my mom through His eyes.  The freedom to allow myself to know and believe who I am in Christ, and not the words my mom spoke to me, was is like a breath of fresh air.</p><p>What God taught me in the years following is that forgiving others is a critical part to our spiritual walk. Harboring unforgiveness is like saying come on in Satan wreak havoc in my life. But I know even after we forgive, sometimes the wound itself may continue to need more healing in some cases.</p><p>For me, something I sometimes struggle with is distinguishing between what is my part, and what is God’s part.  I have found that forgiveness isn’t about having more faith. It is about obedience. Forgiveness is our responsibility and choice, not God’s. We need to choose to forgive. Why- because God forgave us, and He tells us to do so.  Just take a moment and think about the things God has forgiven you for in your lifetime.  Another difficulty I sometimes have is the disconnect between my head and my heart.  I know the truths of what the Bible says, but sometimes I do not act on them or live them out. We must immerse ourselves in His word, it will cause a heart change.</p><p>Honestly until we forgive, we remain in the enemy’s grip.  We must forgive for our own freedom.  If we do what God asks of us, He will do what we cannot do on our own - change our heart.  Corrie ten Boom said, “Forgiveness is the key which unlocks the door of resentment and the handcuffs of bitterness”.  Brothers and sisters in Christ, forgiveness is not easy, but unforgiveness is a life in chains.</p><p>Father, continue to instill in us the desire to be in your word and live it out.  Help us to have your heart of forgiveness, not particularly for our transgressors, but for our transformation.  You alone are our peace!!  May we be more and more like you each day! In Jesus precious name. Amen</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1554321083550-Z488N9X78RBGWRQ227U8/DebbieBlog_4-9-19.jpg,265
266,Serving with His Eyes,post,2019-05-14 13:00:00,Volunteering,/blogfeed/2019/5/14/serving-with-his-eyes,<p>Today’s blog is written by Candace Saunders on how we should serve.</p>,"<p><em>“However, I consider my life worth nothing to me; my only aim is to finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me—the task of testifying to the good news of God’s grace.” </em></p><p>Acts 20:24</p><p>For most of my preteens into teens I was always at church. My dad had turned a life of drugs and alcohol into a life of pursuing Christ, which for him meant becoming a youth pastor. When I say we were always at church, I often felt like I saw the walls of our youth room more than my own house. People would say things like, “thank you for all that you do with our church,” or “you’re always serving with such a grateful heart.” At times I loved what we did at church and the ways we were able to help and serve others, but by the end of high school it was something I felt I had to do, since I was the “youth pastor’s kid.” </p><p>I went off to college and attended church, but never truly got “plugged in.” I told myself I was too busy or it would stress me out too much with school, but the truth was I was selfish and fearful that I wouldn’t be good enough at whatever I was tasked with. </p><p>Fast forward to the year after I graduated college and I found myself spending a year overseas in many different countries, doing mission work. It was during this time that I saw people hike hours, literally, in the foothills of Mt. Everest to worship and serve their communities, people rebuilding homes of people they knew nothing about, and loving on people who literally cursed them because they were believers. Many of them told me the reason they still served was because someone served them and that was how they came to know Jesus. </p><p>Slowly in these moments God began to show me how He sees His children. He began to show me how he created each unique life, each unique heart. This was when I began to serve with an overflowing, abundant heart. Volunteering at the Point has only further solidified the importance of serving, having the opportunity to serve the community in which I live and a people that I’ve come to know and love. </p><p>When we serve, we are so close to God, His nature, His character. His own son spent His entire life on earth serving others so they could know Him. How amazing is it that we have the opportunity, that He invites us in to let someone else experience Him by our service? </p><p><strong>Prayer </strong></p><p>Father, help me and each of us to see that you’ve given us a gift and opportunity when we serve. Help us to see others the way that you see them, for when we do, we will never want anything more than to be the hands and feet of Jesus. Thank you for bringing us in to your kingdom and giving us the chance to show and help someone know you. Thank you for giving us life and joy as we serve one another. </p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1557754152038-VA4XH15T1F56YN4BRPKX/5.14.19_CandaceSaunders.jpg,267
268,Why I Volunteer,post,2019-05-21 13:00:00,Volunteering,/blogfeed/2019/5/21/why-i-volunteer,<p>Today’s blog is written by Bryce Hall on why he volunteers.</p>,"<p><strong>Focus verse</strong>: Mark 10:45 <em>“For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.""</em> </p><p>One of the reasons why I love this verse is because our example, Jesus, never calls us to do anything he hasn’t already done for all of us. The King of kings was born in a manger, humbled himself, and took a lowly position as a servant.</p><p>Around this time last year, I was not serving or volunteering at the Point. I didn’t really have an understanding of why I should serve and the significance of serving. The reason why I joined was because I was listening to a pastor speak and he talked about when you volunteer and serve at church and surround yourself with a community of believers you begin to get into a flow of people who are on the same path and pursuit of the same Godly things as you. And it’s funny because just a few weeks ago I was chatting with the head coach for the UVA boy’s basketball team Tony Bennett at an event and he was telling me how he actually met his wife volunteering and serving in the youth ministry.</p><p>Through volunteering at the Point and serving with the high school students, God is building my character. He’s teaching me valuable lessons that are preparing me for my destiny and the plan that he has for my life and he wants to do the same for all of us. When you serve where God has placed you and are faithful in things that seem insignificant, character begins to be developed in you where He prepares you for your destiny. </p><p><strong>Reflection</strong></p><p><em>“For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ, we though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others. We each have different gifts according to the grace given to each of us”</em> (Romans 12:4-6)</p><p>We all play a pivotal role in the body of Christ to serve with the gifts that God has placed in us to the rest of the world. How can you help make a difference through your service where God has uniquely placed you?</p><p><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p>God, thank you for placing us right where we are now. Help us to be faithful in the little things that you’ve called us to be obedient in and build in us a humble spirit. Give us wisdom to see the value in serving and help us to find our place in your kingdom to help make a difference. In Jesus name, we agree.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1557753558852-IZZV9F16IML6M7V499RE/5.21.19_BRYCEHALL.jpg,269
270,Why I Serve in StudentLife,post,2019-05-28 13:00:00,Dream Team,/blogfeed/2019/5/28/why-i-serve-in-studentlife,<p>Today’s blog is written by Andrew Hopun on why he serves.</p>,"<p><strong><em>“</em></strong><em>In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.”</em> (Matthew 5:16 ESV)</p><p>These days, the brightest and most frequent light our students may see is their phone. If I’m being honest, I should include myself in that. Though, not everything we see on our phones is harmful. God can be glorified through sending encouraging text messages, showing love through social media, or consoling a friend on a phone call. However, our phones can also make us accessible to messages that promote hatred, evil, and fear. Given this reality, it is very important for our students to be involved in a spiritual community.</p><p>I could describe my teenage years as three things: cringeworthy, even more cringeworthy, and full of growth. As painful as it might be to look back, I believe there’s an important reason that “cringeworthy” is a stereotypical description for our teenage years. Those years are a crucial time of identity formation as we grow into adults. We try new things, make mistakes, and celebrate our successes. We ask tough questions because we’re looking for answers on how to “do life.” Going through all of this can be emotionally draining for teens and can lead them to develop mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression. I serve in student ministry because I’ve seen firsthand the effects of teen suicide on my family and a community. Students need to know the love and strength God can provide during our darkest moments. </p><p>In addition to trying to figure out how to “do life”, teenagers have many pressures on them. They are balancing jobs, extracurricular activities, school assignments, and their family’s calendar. Oh right, they also have to find time for God somewhere in there. Does this last one sound relatable? The most important relationship in our lives gets placed on the backburner due to earthly pressures. The only time some of our students have to get to know God is during StudentLife events. How I see it, every moment we spend with students in StudentLife may be critical to their salvation.</p><p><strong>Reflection</strong></p><p>How do you currently have an impact on students? Do you work with them directly? Maybe you try to distance yourself from teenagers. Even then, do you come across them from time to time in real life? Adults are seen as role models, even from afar. How can you take one step to better encourage students’ spiritual development? How can we make God’s love the brightest and most frequent light in students’ lives?</p><p><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p>Jesus, I am so thankful for your unconditional love and grace. Give us the wisdom and strength to be good role models for our students. Let our words and actions shine brightly as Your love for the students in our communities. Amen.</p><p><br/></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1558014851110-DZ3N5T8FAYB1ZRXFBH2S/blog_andrewhopun5_28_19.jpg,271
272,Freedom From Perfection,post,2019-05-07 13:00:00,,/blogfeed/2019/5/7/freedom-from-perfection,<p>Today’s blog is written by Kelly Dampier on Freedom from Perfection.</p>,"<p>“<em>But he said to me, ""My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness."" Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.” </em><strong><em>2 Corinthians 12:9</em></strong><em> </em></p><p>Do you ever feel like you’re failing at everything? No matter what you do, or the control you try to hold tightly on to, you’re just never hitting the mark, stride, sweet spot of peace and happiness that you ‘think’ will make life better and easier. I have to confess that I feel this way, quite often. I’m a lover of control, of keeping things peaceful at all times, and keeping conflict far away and a perfectionist to my core.</p><p>I know I cannot be alone in this, and that many of us deal with depression, anxiety, and lack of joy, because of the unreal expectations we pile onto ourselves.</p><p>You can imagine how these things gather together (in a self-made grenade of implosion), as I am also a ministry wife, mother of two kids ages 5 and under, and trying to find my footing in a new state and new home. Can I tell you that while I am always grappling with these burdens, because I’ll never find perfection this side of eternity, I have found joy and peace to counteract it all? Would you like to know the source? Jesus.</p><p>My need for control and perfection took a massive hit in the fall of 2017. We were expecting our third child, and quietly hoping for a boy to add to our family of girls. At 20 weeks pregnant I was at the gender reveal ultrasound, by myself, and was told that our child was no longer living. I can remember in the moments leading up to this bombshell, as things seemed off and not quite right, I was alone and staring at the sterile, cold ceiling. I said out loud in an empty room, ‘Jesus, I think I’m about to need you like never before. Please be near.’</p><p>I composed myself, tear soaked and barely able to see, and I drove home. We called to be admitted to the hospital, labor was induced, and twelve hours later we delivered our baby into a quiet room. Every single part of my life was spinning out of control. Control I’ve always tried to hold onto so tightly. Peace was elusive. Grief was all encompassing. Lies from the devil took root in my heart, and all the things that trauma does to you became my new normal.</p><p>We had the most incredible support system of prayer, love, and care. I could not have survived without it. My sweet husband played a constant stream of worship music, from the drive to the hospital and all the way through to our drive home, leaving our baby behind. This one act on his part is probably what saved me. Constantly keeping our focus on Jesus. (By the way, we got to briefly hold and see the face of our hoped-for son. He was perfect.)</p><p>The story of loss never ends, and the journey through immense heartbreak and crippling anxiety has been one that only Jesus and I know the depths of. You see though I had a choice, we all do, actually, which road will we take? The one that leads to self-reliance, covering up, putting on old masks, and acting like we have it all together? This path leads ultimately to our own undoing. There’s another choice, although it’s painful and requires a lot of self-sacrifice. It’s a way of complete surrender, and opening the ugly, imperfect parts of our story that we don’t like at all. It’s a choice to fully, unreserved, with all that we have, go after Jesus. Actually, we don’t really have to go far at all. He’s ever present, and always waiting to wrap us up in His peace-filled embrace. Because did you know, He has scars too? He is the only one to have ever walked this earth that knows the EXACT level of your disappointment, anxiety, fears, hurt and brokenness. He took it all upon himself on the cross. Although He is totally God, He was also human, and He was taking on every ounce of what that means, in order to save us. To save you.</p><p>That’s the realization I had to come to, and the depth of the love that brought me into freedom. I believe you can find it too. You’re not failing. You’re actually living and learning what works or doesn’t. You can never reach perfection here on earth, so go ahead and give it up. Your anxiety is built on lies that the devil would love to use to keep you down. God’s truth says this: <em>“Let those who fear the Lord say, ""His steadfast love endures forever."" Out of my distress I called on the Lord; the Lord answered me and set me free. The Lord is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do to me?”</em> Psalms 118:4-6.</p><p>Here’s all that you need to do, right now. Make your life one of unending worship and relationship with Him. Constantly laying everything down at the feet of the One who just wants you to give it up already. It’s hard and I miss the mark a lot. I am an imperfect person here! You will miss the marks too, but choosing Jesus before ourselves is grace and freedom in its truest form. I’m sick of feeling inadequate. I’m doing something about it, how about you?</p><p><br/><strong><em>Prayer</em></strong></p><p><em>Jesus, I don’t want to carry these burdens anymore. I’m so tired, weary, and done with feeling inadequate and broken. Trying to put on a mask of perfection. I know that you say to lay it all at Your feet, so here I am. I am an open book to You. Please wrap me in peace and in your healing love.</em></p><p><em>My only desire is to know You more. I will stay here in this special place of just You and I, I will listen for Your voice.</em></p><p><em>I praise you for all that You are, and for all that You did for me on the cross. For you to step down from Heaven and feel everything that I’m feeling right now, is the greatest love I’ve ever known. Thank you. I love you. I want freedom. </em></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1556548914287-J9RT1V92FCI6FDFIS8VH/5.7.19_Perfection_KellyDampier.jpg,273
274,Why I Attend A Group,post,2019-06-11 13:00:00,Groups,/blogfeed/2019/6/11/why-i-attend-a-group,<p>Today’s blog is written by Mary Bentley on why she attends a group.</p>,"<p><em>“Even in old age they will still produce fruit, they will remain vital and green; they will declare, The Lord is just!  He is my rock! There is not evil in Him.”</em>  <strong>Ps 92:14-15 – NTL</strong></p><p>I am grateful for the fruit bearing promise of Psalm 92 because I didn’t even get planted until middle age.  I was saved on a Friday evening, April 11, 1997.  I am happy to share my salvation story if you ask me.  That night changed my life forever – gave me a purpose and passion that thankfully has not dimmed in over twenty years.</p><p>Giving your life to Jesus at any age can dramatically affect your relationships.  You begin to think differently, act differently, “want” differently.  Even as a church goer there is a shift in your relationships.  For almost twenty years I persevered in prayer and fellowship with women I deeply loved in a Women’s Bible Study.  A time came when I could no longer stay true to my understanding of the Bible, and I left that church.   I found the Point through the invitation of some friends who had left before I did.  I knew I had found “home” the very first Sunday in September 2016.  The music, the preaching, and most powerfully, the invitation to others to accept Jesus as Lord and Savior, thrilled my heart.</p><p>It took me a year to join a women’s group.  Looking back, I don’t know why.  Well, yes, I do.  After I left my former church, I had continued in Bible study with these women I still love.  It took God’s putting a book, He had put on my heart several years prior, that I could never persuade the other women to study, on the heart of a Point group leader.  I found this out during a “chance” encounter with her.  I use more quotation marks since knowing God.  With Him there are not coincidences.  I signed up!!</p><p>Although I had been in a women’s Bible study with the same group of women for a long, long time, it had not prepared me for what community means at The Point.  I give God all the glory for what The Point version means.  It means transparency, it means accountability, it means intimacy, all with Jesus as the focus.  It means so much more than friendship and for me it means a constant reigniting of that purpose and passion I mentioned earlier.</p><p>The women in my group have helped me look into the face of Jesus.  I know Him better because we seek Him together, every week, through prayer and study, and often by texts and phone calls throughout the week as life presses in.  We are bearing fruit in our lives for His kingdom, in and for each other, and beyond.</p><p>Prayer – Father, thank you for my salvation.  Thank you for the wonderful group of women who love you, who surround and encourage me, as we live our lives together for your glory.  Amen</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1560172385618-IXQ6VM1069R8GVEML5T8/6.11.19_MaryBentley_Blog.jpg,275

John would have prevented him, saying, ""I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"" But Jesus answered him, ""Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness."" Then he consented.”</em> - <strong>Matthew 3:13-15</strong></p><p>In January 2006, I had a wild idea: I would apply to graduate school.  It might not seem that wild now, but in January 2006, I had only been teaching for 5 years, I had a one year old at home, and a husband who would start attending classes toward his own degree.  I was heavily involved in student activities and regularly up late grading papers or writing lesson plans.  I envisioned that one day I might want to become a school leader - an assistant principal, a principal, or a district curriculum writer.  By that point, I hadn’t even served as a department chair.  I had no leadership experience.  But I imagined that one day, I would want that kind of leadership - and I needed to be prepared.  </p><p>When I reflect on who I was in 2006, I understand that I wasn’t where I needed to be yet.   I didn’t have the minimum requirements to apply for a position.  I hadn’t served on the teams or in the roles that would prepare me for leadership opportunities.  I was just a great teacher with the desire that one day I might want to do more.  </p><p>Fortunately, Jesus provides a model of preparation.  As Jesus was preparing to enter ministry, he went to be baptized by John the Baptist.  Even when John protested, asking “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me,” Jesus insisted.  Jesus had all that he needed to begin his ministry, but he fulfilled the requirement anyway, demonstrating for us how necessary it is for us to be prepared for what God will do in our lives. </p><p>I wonder how many of us have been obedient to God’s call to preparation.  We cannot imagine all that God will do in our lives, all of the lives we will reach, all the work He will do through us, all the changes He will orchestrate in our hearts.  He’s telling us to get ready.  Get that degree.  Apply for that position.  Start studying the Word.  Apply for your passport.  Start building that relationship.  </p><p>I would hate to miss an opportunity to serve God because I wasn’t ready for it.  So I’m getting prepared.</p><p><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p>Lord, I want to be ready for what you’re calling me to, what you’re awakening in my heart.  Show me how you want me to ready myself.  </p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1560172213800-5LYTMVOZQSOTQJAG1AYJ/AllisonPoindexter_Blogpost_6-18-19.jpg,277
278,Prayer,post,2019-06-25 12:00:00,Prayer,/blogfeed/2019/6/25/prayer,<p>Today’s blog is written by Lynne Sade on Prayer</p>,"<p><em>“I should be spiritually free and expressive as I pray, but I should also be thoughtful and mindful as I pray.  I should sing with my spirit and sing with my mind.  If you give a blessing using your private prayer language, which no one else understands, how can some outsider who has just shown up and has no idea what’s going on know when to say ‘Amen’?  Your blessing might be beautiful, but you have very effectively cut that person out of it.”</em><br/><strong> - 1 Corinthians 14:16-17 (MSG)</strong><br/> <br/> I used to not be a pray-out-loud kind of girl.  Saying those intimate words so loud that others can hear them seemed awkward at best, and pushy at worst.  The exception of course is grace around the dinner table with family, when it’s understood to be more of a cultural experience at least for my family of Southern roots, but when I am really talking to God I’ve always felt privacy was the best method for me.<br/> <br/> Just over two years ago, my husband and I welcomed a beautiful baby boy into the world, and he was more amazing than I could have ever prayed for.  But things took a turn for the worst when he was around three months old that left every one of Charlottesville’s pediatric providers scratching their heads.  He refused to breastfeed or bottle feed, he had intense startle reflexes preventing him from sleeping more than 43 minutes in a row, he randomly stopped breathing, and most of all, he was “failure to thrive.”  That term, to all of you folks out there who haven’t encountered it intimately, is a terrifying one to hear with regard to your own child.  He was hospitalized when he was four months old with an EEG on his sweet baby scalp and specialists checking in around the hour. No one seemed to understand why he was experiencing those symptoms, and watching the scales slide backwards hurt me in the pit of my stomach more than anything I’ve experienced before or after.<br/> <br/> It was during this very public hospitalization that my husband and I had to put down our veil of privacy over prayer.  With a constant stream of doctors and nurses and other providers visiting our son’s bedside, there just wasn’t an opportunity to pray over our son alone and in solitude.  We had no other option than to pray, and pray out loud, and pray out loud in front of whomever happened to be in the room at that time.  It was far outside of my comfort zone, but it was the only thing that relieved that pit in my stomach.<br/> <br/> I hoped I could say that with our public prayers, a miracle happened, and he was immediately healed. But God doesn’t always work like that, and I sure am grateful He doesn’t!  Over the course of a few more months our son got better, and we received apologetic phone calls from the providers who misdiagnosed him.  With time he grew into a healthy, strong baby and at two and a half years old now, you’d never know he struggled so much in his infancy.</p><p>Fast forward the story, though, to last fall.  We were expecting another baby and had just crossed the threshold to the second trimester. On the morning of a previously scheduled ultrasound, the bleeding started… and it didn’t stop.  I ended up hemorrhaging so much blood that I lost consciousness numerous times until I finally coded on the hospital bed.  The emotional and physical pain was more than I wanted to bear.  The last words I spoke to my husband before I coded were, “I just don’t want to be in this body anymore.”<br/></p><p> A near-death experience is not something that could ever fit into the confines of a one-time story, let alone a blog post.  I’m sharing this with you to show how God’s plan is so much better than we can ever conceive.  Because in that moment when my heart wasn’t able to pump the blood it needed to, when the nurses raised the foot of my bed high in the air so blood could flow to the upper half of my body, with alarms beeping loudly and rapidly, when dozens of people suddenly flooded my hospital room… I couldn’t see a thing.  I couldn’t feel a thing.  But I could hear.<br/> <br/> And what I heard was my husband praying out loud.  Not quietly, privately, reservedly, or timidly; no, he was all-in-praying-out-loud. We hadn’t really prayed out loud together since the fear of losing our son, but my husband prayed as freely and as energetically as if he’d been doing it every moment of his life.  I heard every word.  I remember making a conscious choice to go back into my body even though I knew the alternative was painless and I desperately wanted a relief from the pain.  His prayers saved me.<br/> <br/> I had spent months and months confused by God that our prayers for our son in the hospital didn’t instantly heal him, and angry at the trauma God put me through as a result of that experience.  Little did I know that God had a much bigger plan.  Now our family of four doesn’t just pray at the dinner table, we pray out loud together… all the time.  Our daughter has learned the power of prayer at the age of four and our son is memorizing the Bible verses we pray out loud over him.</p><p><br/> If that’s not the biggest reason to say “Amen,” what is?</p><p>Thank you, Lord, for always knowing our needs even before we do</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1561047061178-GM9424G5NTHFGYTMP6OU/6-25-19_lynnesade_blogpost.jpg,279
280,Community,post,2019-06-04 20:59:03,Groups,/blogfeed/2019/6/4/community,<p>Today’s blog is written by Josh White on community.</p>,"<p><strong>Acts 2:42 </strong>“They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to <strong>fellowship</strong>, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.”</p><p>	The word fellowship in this verse is the word <strong><em>Koinonia</em></strong> in the original Greek language. Koinonia encompasses much more than just what its definition entails. It does mean “fellowship” or “communion” and we can understand it as such in the English language, however, it means a fullness of community and essentially a participation in the body of Christ. As believers we have a bond that transcends all that separates us as humans, societal and economics backgrounds, ethnicity, race, and the like. We have a relationship with Christ where he transforms us by His sacrifice on the cross and welcomes us as sons and daughters into His glorious kingdom of light. This creates a communion that is deeper even than the blood that twin brothers would share. This is the strength of the word Koinonia. </p><p>Our group environments are meant to be places where we truly live out the calling for authentic and blessed community. When my wife and I first came to The Point, the very first Sunday we stepped foot into the church, we were invited to a community group. We were immediately swept up in an authentic community of believers who shared life together. We shared meals together, cried together, prayed together, served the community together, ultimately grew together. The true fellowship of believers is deeper than a social club or a weekly gathering to just ‘catch up’ or have something to fill your calendar. It is as Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the great pastor and theologian who died at the hand of the Nazis said, </p><p>“I have community with others and I shall continue to have it only through Jesus Christ. The more genuine and the deeper our community becomes, the more will everything else between us recede, the more clearly and purely will Jesus Christ and his work become the one and only thing that is vital between us. We have one another only through Christ, but through Christ we do have one another, wholly, for eternity.” </p><p><strong>Prayer: </strong></p><p>Thank you Lord that as a believer I get to experience true community. I get to experience fellowship as you meant it to be prior to our Fall in the garden. True fellowship only comes from being in communion with You and in communion with your people. Surround me with those to encourage me to be more like you and to live a life that drives more people to You.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1559682642323-L2W8J1JP7VXNG42DIFLY/JoshWhite_Blog.jpg,281
282,God’s Masterpiece,post,2019-07-16 11:12:00,,/blogfeed/2019/7/16/gods-masterpiece,<p>Today’s blog is written by Kathy Burns.</p>,"<p><em>“For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago.”</em> <strong>Ephesians 2:10</strong></p><p>My granddaughter has autism. My beautiful, sweet granddaughter has danced to a different drummer for a while now. I knew there was something about her that made her a little different. She is highly intelligent, has always been extremely verbal with a vocabulary way beyond her age. She is affectionate and compassionate and the only person in her family who really loves their cat. How could she be autistic? </p><p>I am so grateful I had my wonderful community group of women to share this news with shortly after I found out. We were studying a lesson about Ruth and Naomi. We discussed how we often believe the labels we and others attach to us over the way our heavenly Father, our perfect Creator, sees us. Not surprisingly, I lost it before it was even time to share prayer requests! All I could think about was how my beautiful girl was going to have to deal with labels times ten as an autistic child. How was her little spirit not going to be crushed by ignorant people who don’t know her or understand autism? Thankfully, on that day one Scripture after another reminded me that God is our label maker, not us, not other people. My little granddaughter already has a sweet love for Jesus that will be nurtured by her parents and grandparents. My prayer for her is that she will hold God’s sweet words, His truths, in her heart and wear them like a shield. I pray she will truly understand she is a chosen child of God. God has a unique and special plan for my granddaughter as He does for each of my five granddaughters. What a blessing it is to know that!</p><p><strong>Reflection</strong></p><p>We all need to put on the armor of God each and every day. We are not the labels we and others give us. No one knows us like our Father, and no person will ever love us the way He does. Psalm 34:8 says “Open your mouth and taste, open your eyes and see - how good God is. Blessed are you who run to him.” </p><p><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p>Father, you have created me from your image and for a purpose. Help me to remember to put on your armor every day so that I may live for you. Give me the courage to run to you first when I face trials. Help me to see myself as you see me - beloved and chosen. In Jesus’ name, amen. </p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1563279824052-28WTQ76IETN3XAOMR8UR/7.16.19_KathyBurns.jpg,283

Hmmm…this situation could be an opportunity FINALLY to prove that Jesus wasn’t who he said he was.  So, after complaining to the disciples, but before the disciples had a chance to make any comments or give any answers, Jesus spoke with what is recorded in Matthew 9:12 &amp; 13b.  Jesus’ answers always went straight to the core of the issue and he explained it in a way that was….well, it should have been easy to understand, shouldn’t it?  </p><p>The Pharisees could not see their own blindness, their unrighteousness and quite honestly, their “own hand in front of their face”.  They truly thought they were righteous and therefore saw no sin in their lives.  Therefore, no need for a Savior.  Matthew, on the other hand, knew exactly who he was…it was public knowledge.  Everyone knew about those tax collectors.  They cheated, stole, “skimmed off the top”; Matthew knew he was a sinner.  He felt there was no hope for him, so I’m sure he had reconciled himself to a life of sin.  </p><p>Then…one day, Matthew met JESUS!  Five life-changing words…one day I met JESUS, one day you met JESUS!  And the unexplainable happened, eyes were opened and immediately Matthew, me, you…we were aware that as sinners, we had just found our Savior.  It really wouldn’t have mattered if the disciples had offered an explanation before JESUS said anything, Matthew wasn’t listening to them.  He was only hearing the words of JESUS, “I have come to call not those who think they are righteous, but those who know they are sinners”.  Matthew knew he was a sinner and for the first time, he discovered there was hope for him, there was a Savior.  He didn’t have to continue to live as a sinner nor die as a sinner.  He had experienced the glorious revelation that Jesus had come to save him from his sins.”  From that day forward, Matthew never ceased to follow Jesus.  </p><p>The glorious news is…we don’t have to cease following JESUS either!</p><p>Prayer:  Father God, you are holy and just; you are loving and kind; you are patient and never give up on us.  Thank you, Father, for your magnificent obsession with your children.  As we ponder Matthew’s encounter with Jesus, please remind each of us of our individual encounters with Jesus.  Oh, Father, that we would so vividly remember our first encounter with Jesus that we would fall to our knees with the resolve to never cease from following Him.</p><p>In the precious and holy name of your only son, Jesus Christ!  Amen and Amen</p><p> </p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1561659557773-FIYDO3SG6VQWNRCUSFTJ/7.2.19_doctor.jpg,285

I should be able to get that too!”  Or, “Wow, my friends are still about to go out most nights!? Must be nice to go out and do whatever you want <em>all</em> the time!”  The list goes on. </p><p>Why do we think like this?  Unfortunately, we are all subject to comparison, but that’s why we need to constantly look to the LORD!</p><p>I’m not saying that if you have a huge house and drive a nice car, you’re a sinner. There are people who are deeply rooted in material possessions.   SO many people look to earthly things in order to fill a void in their heart that they can’t seem to fill.</p><p>People in biblical times had this problem.   It’s human nature to compare.  But comparing doesn’t need to lead to envy.  </p><p>I had an envious heart.   People I was close to bought extravagant things to fill the void in their lives.  It was not obvious what they were doing at first, but by God’s grace, I now see.  Now, I look at them with sadness.  They could have so much more than these earthly things, and it’s free!  The great price has already been paid by Christ.  They just need to simply accept it.  Unfortunately, people like this will continue to look for things to make them content, and they will never find it.  </p><p>Why envy that?!?  There’s no truth in earthly material.  It’s all distraction.  </p><p>How about another take:</p><p>All of us are sinners.</p><p>Doesn’t it always seem as though some people get away with everything?  </p><p>Example:  Two believers were speeding.   One of them gets a ticket, the other doesn’t.  Could the one that gets the ticket be envious of the other?  Absolutely.  Both believers ignored the laws of the land.  Both technically broke the law.  Instead of being envious of getting out of the situation- realize that in fact you both have the same Father and are both in the wrong- one of you just didn’t get “wacked”.  </p><p>Can you imagine what our lives would be like if we were 100% every second of our days just zealous for our LORD?!  We need a paradigm shift in our thinking- which focuses beyond worldly material.    Instead of seeing someone with an envious eye- pray for them. Recognize that earthly rewards are deceptions towards the ultimate reality.   </p><p><strong>Reflection</strong></p><p>Is your heart envious?  Is it hard to compare yourself to others without envying them?  If so, why?</p><p><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p>God, I thank you for continually showing me grace even though I always fall short on worldly things.  I pray that you melt away my envious heart but keep me centered and focused on what truly matters, and that is you,  your law, and your love.

288,My Father is always working!,post,2019-07-30 11:15:00,,/blogfeed/2019/7/30/my-father-is-always-working,<p>Today’s blog is written by Melody Criswell</p>,"<p>Jesus said, “My Father is always working” (John 5:17). We brag about OUR daddies; He brags about HIS Daddy. Recently, I got a rare glimpse “behind the veil” that covers everything that God does for us and protects us from… things that we don’t normally get to see.</p><p>A plumber came to fix a leak in my garage wall. He told me to call a roofer and referred one who could come out that day. (For some reason, there seemed to be a sense of urgency inspired by God.)  The roofers plugged some holes and were leaving when the older guy told the rookie to get the big ladder down – – he sent him way up the side of the house to a higher point in the wall. There was something that looked odd to him. He just wanted to check it out. The younger guy climbed way up, looked at a very small hole in the wall, pulled something out and yelled, “I found the source of the leak. But you have a bigger problem”.</p><p>He reached deep into the exterior wall and pulled out a smoldering PVC drainage pipe. The clear pipe was charred through in places; glowing bright red in other places.  It was too hot to touch. There was an insulation “no freeze” wire wrapped around the pipe, which had malfunctioned. Both men looked at me, incredulous and shaken up. God might have just used them to save my house and my life.</p><p>This was very deep in the wall. At least the whole side of my wooden house might have been burning, before a smoke alarm would have gone off.  By the time any of my neighbors noticed anything – – it might’ve been too late. But GOD SAW. And my Father, Who “is always working”, took care of it!  God showed me what He just saved me from, and the picture of that PVC pipe is a perfect example of the enemy’s intentions, how God saves us, what He saves us from, and how He solves all sorts of problems that we never even know about! </p><p>A plumber came to find a leak, and instead a roofer found a fire! It was a burning “secret time bomb”, and God exposed it! He rescued me and I’m sure it’s one of countless times that He has rescued me. I have deep, sweet sleep, total confidence, and many hallelujahs. And I’m nobody special. What He does for me, He does for you. All the time.</p><p>Father, thank You that You are always working on our behalf. Thank You that NOTHING ever surprises You! Thank You that You are “El Roi”, the God Who sees (Gen. 16:13) what the one who came to “steal, kill and destroy” is doing, and You save us regularly!  Thank You for how You love and take care of Your family all the time.  I am so grateful. I love You back. Let my life honor You.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1564404335580-9GGX2DGDK13ZLHY3OGZS/Melody_social_july30-2019.jpg,289
290,What Comfort Zone?,post,2019-07-09 12:43:00,REACH,/blogfeed/2019/7/9/what-comfort-zone,<p>Today’s blog is written by Amanda Ehart on getting out of our comfort zones.</p>,"<p><em>Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.  In all your ways acknowledge Him and He will make your paths straight. </em><strong>Proverbs 3:5-6</strong></p><p>What comfort zone?  God has been having me think about this a lot lately.  Not only has He had me thinking about it, He has been really pushing me out of mine.</p><p>I was recently able to travel to Cuba.  This is the sixth (first with The Point) mission trip I have been on.  I have to admit; this was the first time I was truly nervous about a trip.  You see I’m what I like to call an extroverted introvert. I am a major introvert.  Crowds make me anxious and talking to people (especially new people) is not something I excel at.  The extroverted part comes from the job I have and the team I serve on at church; in those areas I have to be extroverted.</p><p>There were two differences between this trip and previous ones.  The first is the other trips were mainly physical. We built houses and worked behind the scenes (Its surprisingly easy to hide behind a 2X4, hammer, and some nails).  These were perfect for an introvert. When I heard our focus in Cuba was mainly relational my anxiety kicked in overtime. My introverted side tried to take over and I had to pray through anxious thoughts.  Whenever I met a new person or prayed out loud during one of the visits, I had to say a calming prayer before hand, so I could get through it.  </p><p>The second was that the group size was much smaller.  It’s hard to hide in a small group. Especially when we each lead devotions and shared our testimonies.  It’s one thing to talk to people you may never see again. It’s completely different to share part of your life story with people (some we had really just gotten to know on this trip) you see on a weekly basis.  I am so proud of the group I was able to travel with. I am happy to be able to call them friends.</p><p>That said, I am so thankful to God for continually pushing me out of my comfort zone.  I now see a confidence in myself that I haven’t seen before and I didn’t know I could ever have. Going to Cuba was just the latest step in His amazing plan for me; Cuba was an experience I’ll never forget.  Each time I prayed through the anxiety it got easier to do what God wanted me to do. I am so excited to see growth in myself and others as God gets us further out of our comfort zones. Lessons learned from Cuba are that it’s okay to let your guard down, allow people to care about you, let them make your heart happy, and don’t be afraid to dance in the rain.  Most importantly, allow God to lead you out of your comfort zone. You won’t regret any of it. He puts us where we need to be; He won’t steer you wrong.</p><p><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p>God, I thank you for pushing me out of my comfort zone.  I may push back but I am so thankful that you never give up on me.  I know that your plans for me are infinitely better than anything I could ever plan.  I can’t wait to see what you have planned for the next chapter of my life. I pray that as you lead us out of our comfort zones you ease our fears and help us to live out the trust we know we have in you. In your most precious name, Amen!</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1561660932137-VKFQ25K3NF8OAHOQR2UP/comfortzone_7.9.19.jpg,291
292,Embrace Differences,post,2019-08-13 12:36:00,,/blogfeed/2019/8/13/embrace-differences,<p>Today’s blog is written by Jenn Buxton</p>,"<p><strong>Today’s Reading</strong></p><p><em>“For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ.”</em> <strong>1 Corinthians 12:12 </strong></p><p>As the Connections Director, I get the opportunity to meet a lot of new people week to week. I love hearing their stories, hearing what God is stirring in their hearts, and talking to them about God’s beautifully thought-out and purposeful design for <em>them</em> as individuals. I truly love this! I love the realization people have when God reveals this to them. We are all <em>unique and</em> <em>different</em>! However, I’ve really been thinking more about this as it pertains to all of us as a body of believers. </p><p>Something that I think often gets overlooked though, or is maybe taken for granted, is the <em>beauty of our diversity</em>. Throughout 1 Corinthians 12, Paul talks about the many spiritual gifts that we have been given by the Holy Spirit. These gifts all vary person to person. My gifts and personality are not the exact same as yours. We are all different and we were made like this on purpose for a purpose. God did not create us all to be the same carbon copies of each other. Nor should we strive to be like each other. We should be living out who God called us to be and strive to be like <em>Jesus</em>. Together, we have unity in Jesus Christ.</p><p>Even so, our flawed human nature wants things <em>our own way</em>. A lot of times we see our differences, and they cause pain and dissension. But, is that really what God intended? Did God design us to be different and then fight one another to make the other fall in line behind us? No. We aren’t calling everyone else to be like us, we should be calling on Jesus to show us, together in unity, the way forward. Together we find a better way. Two minds are greater than one! Our differences make us stronger. </p><p>As Christians, we have a great opportunity to approach differences and conflict in a God-honoring way. This is where I like to start. 1) I recognize that the person in front of me is an invaluable, child of God. He created them with love and intentionality. 2) I recognize that they might see things differently than I do, so I want to understand and see how they see. 3) I go to God and pray for wisdom. How do we move forward toward a common good for all? What is God’s best for this situation? </p><p>There will be times that you’re in a tough spot and can’t see eye to eye, that’s a larger discussion for another time. You can’t take control or responsibility for others’ actions. However, you can control and take responsibility for how <em>you approach differences</em>. </p><p><strong>Reflection</strong></p><p>Think about your current circumstances: What conflicts are currently in front of you?  Are you approaching them in a Godly way?  If not, what steps can you take to change your perspective, conversations, and actions?</p><p><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p>God, I am incredibly thankful that you have created me and everyone around me uniquely and perfectly in your image. I praise you today that I have brothers and sisters who think and see the world differently, because together we are stronger. Help me to see this truth in every situation and conversation. I pray for your wisdom, your guidance, and your grace – that my words and actions are a reflection of who you are and what you have already done for us in Christ Jesus. In Jesus’ name I pray, amen. </p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1564532517810-ZFY514UI49R7DO2GXIRJ/EmbraceDifferences_JennBuxton_8-13-19.jpg,293
294,Therefore Come,post,2019-08-20 12:38:00,REACH,/blogfeed/2019/8/20/therefore-come,<p>Today’s blog is written by Cody Bryant</p>,"<p><strong>Today’s Reading</strong></p><p><em>Jesus, undeterred, went right ahead and gave his charge: “God authorized and commanded me to commission you:” </em><strong>Matthew 28:18 MSG</strong></p><p><em>Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” </em><strong>Matthew 28:19-20 NIV</strong></p><p><strong>Therefore Come</strong></p><p>During our ‘Out of Commission’ series Pastor Gabe preached on the verses that are known as the “Great Commission” (Matthew 28:18-20). He discussed how our mission field is exactly where God has placed us at any given moment. The “go” in “therefore go” is not necessarily thousands of miles away. Our responsibility and command is constant: we are to make disciples wherever we are. Sometimes though, that “go” <em>is</em> thousands of miles away for some of us. We may feel this nudge on our heart to go on an international mission trip but are not quite ready to say yes. </p><p>When we start answering His calling, the devil may begin to work overtime. The enemy will tell us that we are not qualified, not equipped, or not spiritual enough to go. Perhaps life and work back home while you are away are keeping you from going, or maybe it is the fundraising that seems impossible. The first twelve followers of Christ were ordinary people like you and me, and look how He used them. The great thing about not being enough is that we are loved by a Father that is <em>beyond</em> enough. He does not call the equipped, He equips the called. His provision is proved over and over again in the Bible. </p><p>I love The Message translation of Verse 18, “Jesus, undeterred…” It is time we follow His lead. We should be undeterred in seeking to reach the lost and making disciples. The cost for not obeying that command is far too great. It is about time we start giving Jesus what He paid for. Maybe we should think of “Therefore, go” as “Therefore, COME.” He is already there. As in everything, He has already gone before you and prepared the way for you to serve. He will be with you every step of the way and will take care of everything you leave behind, as we are reminded of at the end of His command in Verse 20. Our God does not answer our obedience with abandonment. If He has placed the desire to go on your heart, do not be sidelined by the enemy’s lies and distractions. He has called you for a specific purpose and will equip you in every way needed. </p><p><strong>Reflection</strong></p><p>Have you thought about international REACH? Do you feel like this is something you are supposed to do, but are hesitant or do not feel like you have what it takes? Ask yourself two questions: Do I love Jesus? Do I want others to know about that love? If you answered yes to both of those then sign up, He will take care of the rest. If you have never given international missions a thought, I challenge you to ask God to reveal to you how you should be involved.  </p><p><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p>Father, I ask that you start a fire within me to share the gospel relentlessly to those around me. Let my utmost desire be to serve you and further your kingdom no matter where I am. Allow me to lay down my life for you and your will. Use me in whatever capacity you feel fit to win souls for Christ.  </p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1564531132832-BPS0EV45RTOJ78BUN4QI/ThereforeCome_CodyBryant_8-20-19.jpg,295

298,Motivation,post,2019-08-06 12:30:00,,/blogfeed/2019/8/6/motivation,<p>Today’s blog is written by Kristen Fields on your motivation. </p>,"<p><em>“A person may think their own ways are right, but the LORD weighs the heart</em>.” (Proverbs 21:2)</p><p>I’ve been struggling with writing this very devotional, starting and stopping for days. Feeling uninspired I casually asked the Lord to lead my thoughts. Truthfully, my words felt like pennies tossed into a wishing well. Then, as I flipped through the psalms, my eyes landed on a passage that pressed the pause button in my soul.</p><p><em>“Incline my heart to your testimonies, and not to selfish gain!”</em> (Psalm 119:36)</p><p>I could almost hear the ding-ding of a railroad crossing bar land in front of me. That moment I recognized what God’s Spirit was after. I’ve authored enough devotionals to know how good it feels to write something someone likes. That last phrase says it all, doesn’t it? I was lacking inspiration because my motivation to please was off track. Instead of writing to please an audience of One, I had your response in mind. Here’s what I know for certain. God cares most about our hearts. Like me, if you feel uninspired, could it be the Lord has stopped you to reveal your motivation? Often, we are interested in pleasing a lesser god like productivity, reputation, or any other thing the world esteems as important.</p><p><em>“Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things; and give me life in your ways.” </em>(Psalm 119:37)</p><p>Illusions also snared my imagination from working at its best. For instance, perfectionism and procrastination pressured me to wait for that ideal moment before tackling this project. Sadly, I even entertained the thought of people praising me. I nearly gag on that confession, but I know I’m not alone. Maybe you can relate? Our hearts want to glorify themselves. To clear out this selfish motivation I reflected on these verses allowing them to speak to me. Sometimes our imaginations need to soak in scripture to be drenched with the light and inspiration of God. </p><p><em>“Confirm to your servant your promise, that you may be feared.”</em> (Psalm 119:38)</p><p>As I turned my attention to these verses, they reassured me. Their straight shot revealed that my shallow motivation had steered me to an empty source - myself. Jesus said, <em>“I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.”</em> (John 15:5) God reveals Himself through lives that are motivated to glorify Him. I was guilty of wanting to impress people. Pride and people-pleasing have no place in the Kingdom of God. Today ask Heavenly Father to purify your motivation. He will inspire you as you aim to please Him.</p><p>Reflection:</p><p>1. Am I motivated to please God or ultimately myself? What is my deepest motivation? </p><p>2. What illusions am I believing? </p><p>Prayer:</p><p>Heavenly Father, cause my heart to bow before You and not to the ideals of this world. Help me turn my eyes away from illusions so that I pursue only that which is true; drench my soul with life as I walk in Your paths. Reassure me of Your promises, for I am your beloved, Your servant who bows before You.

300,Grand Canyon Love,post,2019-09-10 12:00:00,,/blogfeed/2019/9/10/grand-canyon-love,<p>Today’s blog is written by Helen Lockwood</p>,"<p><em>“For I will be merciful toward their iniquities, and I will remember their sins no more.” </em><strong>Hebrews 8:12 (RSV)</strong></p><p><em> “I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love,  may have power, together with all the Lord’s holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ.”  </em><strong>Ephesians 3:16-18 (NIV)</strong></p><p>1974.  Road trip.  Arizona. I couldn’t wait to see the Grand Canyon!  I’d toured the Kettle Moraine in my home state of Wisconsin, but I knew those rock-deposit crevices would be nothing compared to …THE GRAND CANYON!  My impatience grew as we drove next to a deep drop-off to a river below.  Suddenly, it hit me… we’d been driving <em>alongside</em> the Grand Canyon for over an hour!  There was so much more to it than I’d ever imagined!  Fast forward.   2019. Plane trip. Israel.   I couldn’t wait to walk…WHERE JESUS WALKED!  Hearing our guide’s Hebrew words and explanations gave me a thirst for the culture in which Jesus interacted during His earthly ministry.   There was so much more than I’d imagined; ironically, it was because there was so much…less. </p><p>Biblical Hebrew has far fewer words than English. Old Testament Hebrew uses only about 5,000 different words, but those words are packed with meaning.  Fewer words means each word can have multiple meanings. I became acutely aware of the limitations of a huge English vocabulary – what an oxymoron! Translating some Hebrew words with just one English word often doesn’t paint the complete picture; there is more…  much more… Grand Canyon more!  Isn’t that just like our majestic God?  Romans 11:33a tells us, “Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!”  Deeper than any canyon, yet searchable; “Aha!” moments with God, when a word’s meaning suddenly expands….a  word like <em>remember</em>.  There was the conundrum.  If God ‘remembers no more,’ does that mean He forgets? Does He become absent-minded? While that thought brought some vindication for the last time I couldn’t remember where I put my keys, I had a hard time reconciling it to His omniscience. Could our all-knowing God forget – no longer know – something? If so, could He forget me?  </p><p>Enter the Hebrew word ‘<em>zakhar’ </em>which is translated ‘remember’ in English, as in Hebrews 8:12: “For I will be merciful toward their iniquities, and I will remember their sins no more.”  Yet <em>zakhar</em> holds a Grand Canyon of meaning.  Our Western minds link <em>remembering</em> to thought activity, as in thinking about a past event.  Jewish understanding expands that to include actions attached to those thoughts; remembering someone in prayer doesn’t just mean thinking about them, but actually praying for them.   In the Western sense of ‘no recollection,’ forgotten sins run the risk of returning to memory, leaving them open to punishment. But ‘remembering no more’ in the Jewish context means coupling  memories with actions, and God’s action is forgiveness. God’s ‘remembering sins no more’ doesn’t mean He can’t recall them, but that, knowing them all, He consciously decides to forgive!  How great is that love? Immeasurable love.  Perfect love.  Decisive love.  It’s God’s mercy for believers regarding the sins He sees and recalls, but that He actively DECIDES to forgive.  It’s active recollection that brings complete freedom.  It’s peace in trusting that He remembers, yet chooses mercy.  It’s Grand Canyon love!</p><p>Prayer: </p><p> Lord, thank You that Your love for us is immeasurable, that Your ways are not our ways, and that deep, canyon trips with You are eye-opening adventures that last forever.  Help me to be rooted and established in Your love, Your Word, and to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is Your love for us.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1564530120086-9JZZIZ5JM986VLVDSBKB/GCL_9-10-19_HelenLockwood.jpg,301
302,Hold My Hand,post,2019-09-17 12:00:00,,/blogfeed/2019/9/17/hold-my-hand,<p>Today’s blog is written by Jonathan Hickory.</p>,"<p>While spending some much needed “unplugged” time with my family at the beach, my 2 year old son and I were playing in the water. He’s so little, and the waves of the Atlantic are so strong, I refuse to allow him to face the water alone.</p><p>He stands with me, looking out at the wondrous waters before him, his wide eyes squinting beneath the brim of his stars and stripes themed sun hat. I hold his hand firmly, and we plant our feet in the sand together as we brace for the crashing waves together. I know that if I let him go, or if he pulled away from me, he would quickly be swept into the strong current of the water, a dangerous situation for a small child.</p><p>I think about all the times in my life when I have faced the waves of life crashing into me. The times when I stood firm and held my Heavenly Father’s hand, I did not fall. Then I think to the darkest times of my life, when I pulled away from my Heavenly Father and tried to stand firm on my own. The waves quickly overtook me and I found myself struck down and sucked out into deeper waters, in desperate need of my Father to rescue me.</p><p>Have you ever been through a time where you tried to stand by yourself against the crashing waves, telling yourself you could handle it without the strong hand of your Heavenly Father? Have you pulled away from God, and been overcome by the deep waters?</p><p>Proverbs 10:25 says, “<strong><em>When the storm has swept by, the wicked are gone, but the righteous stand firm forever.</em></strong>”</p><p>Know that God is always there standing with you, longing to hold your hand, to stand firm together with you against the waves. If you’ve been overcome and swept into the deep waters, cry out to God and He will be your Rescuer. And once you cry out to Him, and take hold of His strong, guiding hand, don’t ever let go again. Stand firm, hold His hand, and He will help you face the waves of life as they come crashing down.</p><p>Prayer:</p><p>Heavenly Father and Almighty God, thank you that You are my rescuer.  Thank you for saving me.  I know that You will help me to stand firm forever against the storms of the enemy.  Please help me to seek Your guidance and Your strong hand every day.  Amen. </p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1568046591002-WNBKC8AVFFHR32W23O2X/blog_JHickory.jpg,303
304,Even the Small Things,post,2019-09-24 12:00:00,,/blogfeed/2019/9/24/even-the-small-things,<p>Today’s blog is written by Tamara Dias.</p>,"<p><strong>Today’s Reading: </strong>""<em>So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.</em>"" (1 Corinthians 10:31 NIV)</p><p>One of my favorite things about this scripture is the emphasis on <strong>all</strong>. It doesn’t say <em>some</em> or <em>a few</em>, but <strong>all</strong>. This is such a sweet reminder to all of us that God cares about even the smallest of moments during our day. </p><p>As I prepare to kick off another school year, I’m often reminded of the many ways that small things matter. Students notice the high-fives given, the hugs during a rough day, and the waves they see as they board the busses in the afternoon. I used to overlook these moments, until I realized that these actions have a huge impact in the success of their daily routine. To some people, these small gestures may be insignificant. But, to the students, they make a world of difference during their day. </p><p>In the same way that teachers and staff focus on doing the small things to brighten a child’s day, our Father in heaven loves to see us give that same care and diligence to our actions. I love that this scripture mentions eating, drinking, and whatever we do throughout our day. It led me to think: How often do I work to honor God with everything I do? Do I take time to pause throughout the day and check my own actions and attitude? </p><p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Think about your daily routine. How do you honor God in what you do? What moments can you examine more closely, so they bring God glory? </p><p><strong>Prayer:</strong> God, I am so thankful for each day you give to me. Thank you for the reminder that you care about even the smallest of actions that I take. Continue to guide me, so that every part of my day brings glory to you.  Help me to walk with you, hear your voice, and let my actions reflect your work in my life.

There is sheer joy on her face when she knows I’m watching. But I also notice the anxiety she feels when she thinks I don’t see her. There have been times on the playground or playing around the house when she runs into trouble and needs my help, but panic fills her heart and worry floods over her face as she frantically searches for me before I softly remind her, “I’m right here.”</p><p>I’m not a toddler anymore and I have realized hard human realities like the fading applause, the end of a season, or abandonment. These cold feelings can lead to wondering “Does anyone really see me? Do I matter? As adults, we can sometimes find ourselves demanding God’s attention, “Daddy, look at me! Do you see me here? Do you see what I’m dealing with here? Do you even care?”</p><p>If you’ve felt like a shadow in a crowd or invisible to someone or everyone, the hope we have in Jesus is that God does see us.</p><p>Adrian Rogers captures this truth well in such distinct language.</p><p><em>He’s up there on the mountain looking down. He sees right through the dark. You can’t see Him, but He sees you. […] And that thing that looks like it’s going to be over your head is already under His feet.</em></p><p>God sees you right where you are, even if no one else does. You don’t have to demand God’s attention. You already have it. When your hope is in His steadfast love, there is peace in the words, “I’m right here.”</p><p><strong>Reflection</strong></p><p>Considering how God sees you, take a moment and think about how he feels about you. After you’ve reminded yourself of His overwhelming compassion, ask yourself, “If God sees me, how do I see God?”</p><p><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p>God, thank you for seeing me when it feels like no one else does.

308,What Will Jesus Find?,post,2020-11-11 16:32:40,,/blogfeed/2020/11/11/whatwilljesusfind,<p>A blog by Kristin Fields</p>,"<p><em>""May no one ever eat fruit from you again.""</em> (Mark 11:14) Jesus said this to a lone fig tree near the road he and his disciples were travelling. Imagining myself in the scene, I fear I would have been that impulsive disciple piping up with, ""Lord, that’s pretty harsh!” Was Jesus truly angry that a tree did not produce fruit out of season?<br/><br/>Although Jesus was fully human, He was also fully God. God who is slow to anger. We can be certain that any frustration with this verse is due to our limited knowledge, not the nature of Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>The details in Mark 11:12-14 lead us to better understand what Jesus was saying. Scripture says it was <em>""a fig tree in leaf""</em> and <em>""that he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.""</em> (vv. 12-13) <br/><br/>As leaves start to unfurl on fig trees, little knobs also form. They drop from the tree prior to the figs’ fruition. These were a favorite source of food for travelers of Jesus' time. You can picture a single fig tree on the horizon full of bright green leaves and the promise of a delicious snack. <br/><br/>The fact that there were no knobs on this beckoning tree shows it was unhealthy and perhaps dying regardless of how it looked on the outside. Jesus was simply declaring the obvious. He was using this fig tree as an illustration to confront his disciples - and still does.<br/>Keep in mind this occurs just before Jesus enters the temple to clear it. Standing in the Court of the Gentiles, where people from all nations worshiped God, Jesus finds hundreds of people making business transactions and busy with religiosity. <br/><br/>Jesus drove out these hypocrites flipping over their tables and chairs. He even stopped them from taking irreverent shortcuts through the temple. He then boldly taught from the prophet Isaiah who said, <em>“And the foreigners who join themselves to the Lord, to minister to him, to love the name of the Lord, and to be his servants, everyone who keeps the Sabbath and does not profane it, and holds fast my covenant — these I will bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar;  for   my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples .”</em> (Isaiah 65:6-7)<br/><br/>Like the fig tree, Jesus found no spiritual fruit in the temple. It was full of religious people taking their work and busyness very seriously; however, people intimate with God were not found. The people of God looked as though they were in full bloom, but they were not fulfilling their purpose. </p><blockquote><p><em>It is a tremendous thought that if you trust Jesus Christ as Savior, you are now ""a temple of the Holy Spirit."" (1 Corinthians 6:19) He lives in you. </em></p></blockquote><p>Having been grafted to Christ, He has made a way to bear much fruit through you. You can now be a healthy branch abiding in God. <em>""This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples."" </em>(John 15:8)<br/><br/>Realize that God longs for you to share the fruit of being in relationship with Him. Jesus Christ <br/>strategically chose you to reveal Him at this time! (John 15:16) The Holy Spirit equips and empowers you to yield fruit that will feed your generation. What will Jesus find when he looks at your life?<br/><br/>Prayer:<br/>Heavenly Father, thank You for drawing me near through Your Son Jesus Christ. I want to be closer to You, Lord. Please bear Your fruit and be revealed through my life. Amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1605551193257-3SH9GLPXAQPCV5LCZ0UD/AWTY.jpg,310
311,God's Power in Weakness,post,2020-11-12 15:07:57,,/blogfeed/2020/11/4/gods-power-in-weakness,<p>This blog was written by Rich Newsome. </p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading: </strong>“Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.”<strong> </strong> 2 Corinthians 12:7-10 </p><p>Is there anything more countercultural than boasting about your weaknesses? I mean, who does that? Certainly not many people I know. When I reflect on my life, I can think of plenty of times I’ve boasted about something, but I’ve rarely boasted about my weaknesses. I’ve tried to stay humble, but pride is always lurking in the shadows. Pride is something I think all of us have dealt with in our lives and it was no different with Paul. From these few verses, we can learn how God perfectly balances burdens and blessings. Paul came to understand that even a thorn in the flesh can be a gift because it helped him remain humble and completely dependent on God. </p><p>About 20 years ago, God, in His grace and mercy, allowed some very hard things to come into our lives. First, my wife, Mona, got sick. She developed chronic fatigue and chronic pain that completely debilitated her. A few years later, our son starting struggling with drugs. Our life was a mess, but we started to get a glimpse of what Paul learned – that God’s grace is sufficient. We were blessed to be involved with community groups at The Point and I had the privilege of leading a co-ed group and later a men’s group. It was through this time in community that I learned what God can do with weakness because that’s all I could offer Him. I prepared, showed up and poured my heart out in group, but it was the Holy Spirit who did the heavy lifting. Paul said he gladly boasted about his weaknesses so that Christ’s power would rest on him. I would’ve never understood this unless I lived it. I’ve witnessed how God supernaturally brings beauty out of ashes and how He produces fruit out of the most unlikely of circumstances. </p><p>Years ago, I learned an acrostic for the word grace: God’s Riches Available at Christ’s Expense. God gave Paul and us a message of grace – sufficient grace and strengthening grace. God’s grace has saved and continues to save us from our sins, provides for our every need and gives us strength when we are weak. Paul didn’t place his trust in people or in his circumstances. He knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that God loved him even though he dealt with a persistent “thorn in his flesh”. We don’t know what the thorn was, but we can all relate to some kind of challenging issue in our lives. </p><p>So how does this translate to our lives right now? Do we have access to God’s “sufficient grace”? Absolutely! We present our weakness to God and He gives us His strength. When do we do this? Everyday. How do we do this? We spend time with our Lord each day in prayer and Bible reading. We join a community group where we can grow, serve and become spiritually mature. What will be the result? Our self-centeredness and pride will be replaced with a dependence on God and He will begin to transform us into men and women who reflect His image. We will bear fruit that lasts and we will bring honor and glory to Jesus, our faithful and gracious Lord and King.</p><p><strong><em>“Heavenly Father, you are so good and faithful and patient with us. You know our struggle with pride and how we’re prone to try to do things in our own strength. Thank you for allowing the thorns of life which reveal our weaknesses and teach us to rely on your infinite strength rather than our own. Thank you for your grace which is sufficient for our every need. We love you Lord and it’s in the Name of Jesus we pray. Amen!”   </em> </strong></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1605109574553-IWVZ95H2TBPRIDXMGMJS/IMG_8377.jpg,312
313,Planning for the Unexpected,post,2020-11-04 19:32:51,,/blogfeed/2020/11/4/planning-for-the-unexpected,<p>This blog was written by Natalia Burton. </p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading: </strong>“Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the LORD that will stand.” Proverbs 19:21 (ESV)</p><p>I recently saw a post that said, “Can we all agree that in 2015 not a single person got the answer correct to <em>where do you see yourself five years from now</em>?” So true. Who would’ve imagined we’d be living through a global pandemic with continuous uncertainty about the future. Definitely not me!</p><p>I am a planner. I always feel better when plans are set and feel settled when I know what is coming. During this pandemic, planning has been ridiculously hard. There are so many unknowns. There are plans we had set over these past 5 months that were cancelled. Family gatherings. Celebrations. Camps. Trips. My daughter was recently excitedly shopping for her dorm and we were making travel arrangements when her school suddenly announced the dorms would not open - after assigning her a room number and move-in date. Plans upended. My son has been so excited to start high school and play football this fall. But as of now football is cancelled, and he is starting high school virtually. These are just a few examples of how unpredictable life has been during this time of COVID in my family. I’m sure we can all relate and have many examples of plans changing these past 5 months.</p><p>When our plans get disrupted, it is easy to feel overcome with worry and burdened with the weight of all these disruptions and unknowns. God never intended for us to carry these burdens alone. He has also shown time and time again that we don’t need to know exactly HOW he is going to carry out His plans, we just need to TRUST that He is at work and that He is GOOD. </p><p>In this season of unknowns. I am learning the freedom of leaning into God, and the reality that His plans are always greater than mine. So I can rest in the reality that whatever it is, God’s got it. When wrestling with uncertainty, there are a few steps that can help align our hearts with this reality.</p><p>1) <strong>Go to the Word</strong>. Search for Scripture to meditate on that which speaks to what is on your heart. Write it on a sticky note and put it around your house. You can even set a reminder on your phone with that verse in it, so that you are reading it throughout the day, no matter how busy you may be. This helps me focus on God rather than circumstances.</p><p>2)  <strong>Seek the Lord in prayer.</strong>I love the verse, <em>From the end of the earth I will cry to You, When my heart is overwhelmed; Lead me to the rock that is higher than I</em>. -Psalm 61:2 NKJV. We don’t need to rely on our own strength, our own abilities, or our own plans. When we don’t look to God first, it is easy to feel overwhelmed and consumed with worry or fear, especially in this season. But when we feel this way we can cry out to God for peace, clarity, strength, help, hope, healing, and so much more.</p><p>3) As Pastor Gabe has been encouraging us to do, <strong>Take One Day at a Time</strong>.  Don’t get caught up in “what ifs” in the midst of this pandemic. I love this verse from the Passion Translation- <em>Refuse to worry about tomorrow, but deal with each challenge that comes your way, one day at a time. Tomorrow will take care of itself</em>. - Matthew 6:34  We don’t need to worry about the coming months, we can focus on Jesus today, and then tomorrow, we can do the same thing.</p><p>4) <strong>Focus on Gratitude. </strong>When we are thankful for what we have, it is hard to focus on what we don’t have in this season. It always helps me to make a gratitude list when I’m feeling discouraged. Seeing all that God has already blessed us with is a good reminder that He always comes through for us. </p><p>5) <strong>Rest. </strong>When we cast our cares on God, He assures us that we will find rest for our souls. Romans 8:28 reminds us that God is working all things together for our good. Jeremiah 29:11 tells us God’s plans for us are for our wellbeing, to give us hope and a future. We can have peace regardless of the circumstances in the world when we rest in the reality that God is always at work, and His plans are always good. He is FOR US.</p><p><strong><em>“Heavenly Father, we thank you for your love and goodness. We thank you that You are at work in our lives right now, and that Your plans are good. Help us to trust You with all our hearts, and give us peace as we seek You daily. We love you and praise you, in Jesus’ name. Amen.”</em></strong></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1604517634755-8QYLS5X27O4TWFMT6K1U/Image+from+iOS.png,314
315,The Power of Being Thankful,post,2022-11-24 17:04:00,,/blogfeed/2020/11/4/the-power-of-being-thankful,<p>This blog was written by Kristin Fields.</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Readings: </strong>“But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come: For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy…” (2 Tim. 3:1-2) </p><p>“My soul, praise the LORD, and do not forget all His benefits.” (Psalm 103:2)</p><p>Billy Graham said, “Even when life may be difficult, we should thank God for all He does for us – which we do not deserve.” We know too well how difficult days provide ample opportunity to overlook God’s generosity. If concerns become the track our minds ride day after day, news cycle after news cycle, it’s near impossible to shift direction. In fact, our fear and pride direct that very train of thought.</p><p>In his letter to Timothy, Paul shares that people will grow increasingly unthankful in the darkest of days. Like an expert marksman, he nails what is common to all of us – forgetfulness of God’s perfect gifts. Wouldn’t you agree it’s hard to be thankful for something you don’t remember? As a result, this habit of fretting and forgetting fills our souls with darkness. Scripture encourages us to push against these run-away thoughts by remembering God’s goodness. <em>“I will give </em><em>thanks</em><em> to the LORD with my whole heart; I will </em><em>recount</em><em> all of your wonderful deeds.” </em>(Psalm 9:1) Remembering captivates our hearts with thankfulness and joy.</p><p>As we celebrate with thanksgiving this season, intentionally recall and notice God’s goodness toward you. One simple way is to pay attention to the details of your moments. <em>“Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.” </em>(James 1:17) Every moment can be an encounter with God’s goodness. Beauty, ability, provision, any sense of peace and security, any encouragement or glimmer of the Lord Jesus Christ’s character is a good gift meant for you and worthy of recognition. When you thank God anxiety diminishes, discontent decreases, and the presence of the Holy Spirit is evident; not to mention the energizing effect gratitude has on those around us.</p><p>In closing, be encouraged by the gorgeous truth that generosity is an unchangeable trait of your Heavenly Father. He will always give you good gifts. You will always have thanks to give Him. Remembering God’s blessings and having a thankful heart will bring light to your darkest days. <em>“It is good to give thanks to the LORD…” </em>(Ps. 92:1a) </p><p><strong><em>“Heavenly Father, thank You for Your generosity.  Please help me to remember Your constant goodness. I’m so thankful to be the recipient of Your good gifts. It is in Jesus Christ’s generously given name that I pray.

John 12:27</p><p><em>Little boy asleep on a manger bed,</em></p><p><em>Do I see a crown on your tiny head?</em></p><p><em>I know this cannot be, yet in my heart I see</em></p><p><em>Such an awesome thing – I can see a king.</em></p><p></p><p><em>Little baby safe in your mother’s arms,</em></p><p><em>What is this you’re wearing to keep you warm?</em></p><p><em>A purple robe I see; you’re clothed in majesty.</em></p><p><em>Such an awesome thing – you are born a king.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><em>Little son of Mary, how can this be?</em></p><p><em>Three wise kings have come very far to see</em></p><p><em>The one who from his birth is Lord of all the earth.</em></p><p><em>Such an awesome thing – you are king of kings.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><em>Little child, so peaceful and unaware,</em></p><p><em>There’s a crown of sorrow that you must wear.</em></p><p><em>Yet in your eyes I see your wondrous love for me.</em></p><p><em>Such an awesome thing – you will be my king. </em></p><p>When I first wrote these words they were set to music, sort of a Christmas lullaby, but even without the melody or the gentle rhythm, they speak to the wonder and majesty of the Christ child. How we love to linger in the warm glow of the manger scene, but we cannot stay there. We must also remember why it was that Jesus came to be born on that first Christmas night. </p><p>The gospel of Luke tells us that Simeon immediately recognized the infant Messiah when He was brought into the temple, and by the power of the Holy Spirit began to prophesy regarding Him. His eyes beheld a baby, but His heart saw the Savior of the world; a light of revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of God’s chosen people. But Simeon saw something more, for he then turned to Mary and said, “Behold, this Child is appointed for the fall and rise of many in Israel . . . and a sword will pierce even your own soul.” He saw the Savior of the world in all His glory and honor, while also seeing the “crown of sorrow” that Jesus was destined to wear.</p><p>It is good for us to delight in the warm glow of our decorations, gifts, carols and candles this Christmas, but as we do so, let’s not forget the Jesus who was born of a virgin and came into our world for a purpose – to humble Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross – and to become our king, our Savior and our Lord. O come let us adore Him! </p><p><strong><em>“Father, open our eyes, I pray, to see the wondrous love you have for us in sending Jesus to be our Savior. Thank you for that love and grace that was poured out on the cross, and may we ever live to worship you and adore our heavenly king. Amen.”</em></strong></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1608673265465-LHWTOFAIZCSXCAP8R797/IMG_9336.PNG,318
319,Your “Yes” Could Change Lives,post,2020-12-10 21:33:43,,/blogfeed/2020/12/7/your-yes-could-change-lives,,"<p>As Christmas is near and we are thinking about the birth of Jesus, I want to bring our attention for a moment to Mary, his mother and the hardest “yes” she ever had to answer. Let’s step back and remember the huge step of faith Mary took those many years ago.  </p><p>Most young girls at that time and in that area of the world were betrothed/engaged at around 11 or 12 years of age; and generally, to an 18-year-old who now would be able to have a job and take care of a family. In the Eastern world if you were 13 and not married, you were like what we think of as an old maid.  </p><p>Mary was engaged to Joseph, still living with her family. But the day the angel Gabriel appeared to her, changed her life and the world forever. Mary woke up on a typical day, perhaps doing her chores or visiting with family and friends, not even imaging what would come that day.</p><p>I think of all that Luke 1 says……. all Mary heard from the angel Gabriel:</p><p>1 – You have found favor with God. </p><p>2 – You will conceive and give birth to a son.</p><p>3 – You will call him Jesus.</p><p>4 – He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High.  </p><p>5 - He will be given the throne of his father, David, </p><p>6 – He will reign over Jacob’s descendants forever and ever. </p><p>7 – His kingdom will never end.</p><p>Can you even imagine all the thoughts Mary had after hearing this news? Some of which I am sure were that people might not believe her, perhaps even some in her own family. In that time if you were found to be pregnant outside of wedlock you were often times killed. Historically and culturally, it was an honor/shame world in which they lived. Yet her love and trust for God allowed her to say the hard “yes”.</p><p>Sometimes the holiest things we are called to do may be the very hardest. Mary had no idea what this may have cost – for herself, Joseph, her family, her village. Yet she trusted and obeyed and said yes.  </p><p><strong> “And Mary said, “Behold, the Lord’s bond-servant; may it be done to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.“ Luke 1:38<em>.</em></strong> I love this verse. May we all have a heart that agrees – “may it be done to me according to your word”.   </p><p>When was the last time you had a hard “yes” to answer to the Lord? Were you able to answer yes? The only way we are able to answer yes is to be so close that we can hear Him and know Him deeply. Don’t allow fear to overshow what God has for you. God gave us spiritual gifts and wants us to use them. He will always enable these gifts to be utilized for both the benefit of others and His glory.  </p><p>As we celebrate the birth of our Savior this year, let us not forget to be listening to His voice.  Always being available to say “yes” as He calls us to join him.  </p><p><strong><em>“Father, thank you for the greatest gift of your son, let us not take it lightly or for granted. Give us the desire to continue our walk and grow closer each day to always be available to say yes when you ask. Our heart’s desire is to be available at any given moment.   May your will be done in all things. In Jesus name, Amen.”</em></strong></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1607355428234-2QW94576F7R4N9MADC0M/12%3A9%3A20+YourYesCouldChangeLives.PNG,320
321,Act Like Men,post,2020-03-03 14:00:00,,/blogfeed/2020/2/25/act-like-men,<p>Today’s blog was written by Marvic Scoggin.</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading:  </strong></p><p><strong>“</strong>Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, <strong>act like men</strong>, be strong.  Let all that you do be done in love.”  (1 Cor. 16:13-14)</p><p>What is a man?  In some cultures, boys go with men to the woods, bang on logs, whoop and holler, hear traditional stories, endure painful stuff, and come back men for life with all its rights, privileges, and responsibilities.</p><p>Generally, not so in our culture.  It seems more of a blur, like a camera that hasn’t found a sharp focus.  I even wondered at times, age 30 with a wife and two small children, “Am I a man yet?”  (Now I’m a recovering parent of teenagers—20 years after; and yes, I’ve long been a man.)  At some point, boys want to be regarded, treated, and respected as men.</p><p>In today’s culture, though, being a guy can be tough.  Men are routinely dissed and kicked to the curb.  Boys are “trouble” in school.  Some people focus on guys through a tiny coffee straw looking for the worst behavior.  There’s that, no doubt.  All men are sinners; some sin beyond all limits.  But a wider view also finds men of noble character—wise, intelligent, courageous, strong, kind, gentle, loving, trustworthy, protectors of the weak, advocates for the innocent, second chance givers, “no nonsense” disciplinarians, mentors—in short, the kind of men that women, children, and other men need.  If you look hard enough for something, you’ll find it, some say.  It’s true.</p><p>In February, scores of men spent most of a Saturday at The Point VA’s first Men’s Conference.  We guys are sinners saved by God’s grace.  Rather than denying, hiding, or making excuses for sinful, even shameful behavior, some guys stood before all the rest and shared their amazing testimonies of transformation—how God made them new creatures in Christ—turning them from sinful, hurtful behavior to becoming men that others can respect and admire, men to whom others can point and say to their sons, “I want you to be like them, to become what they’ve become.”</p><p>The Corinthian church was rife with problems.   “Paul the man” made a permanent, God-inspired record of those problems as he tackled them in apostolic fashion.  In the closing chapter, he exhorts, <em>“Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, </em><strong><em>act</em></strong><em> </em><strong><em>like</em></strong><em> </em><strong><em>men</em></strong><em>, be strong.  </em><em>Let all that you do be done in love</em>.”  If history and current events teach men anything, they teach us not to take our cues from contemporary culture.  Scripture abounds with timeless qualities of God’s man.  Why not put these two verses to memory and make it your habit to find, remember, and practice qualities of character and descriptors of thought and behavior that can be discovered by any man seeking them?</p><p><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p>“Dear Father, thank You for making me a man and assigning me days to live on Your earth for Your good purpose and glory.  Please open my eyes to see what it means to be a man of God, empower me by your Spirit to become that man, and grant me the wisdom, strength, and courage to be that man all my remaining days.  Amen.”</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1585623748540-U453QBP14V0R7Y2FQUN0/jakob-owens-lkMJcGDZLVs-unsplash.jpg,322

Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.  For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”  On her 70th birthday she was moved to a rehabilitation center.</p><p>After her move to the rehab center little things started to happen.  She wiggled her toes.  She moved her left hand for the first time.  She smiled.  When her daughters came to visit, she seemed to track their movement with her eyes.  They continued to pray.</p><p>This last week, she was able to mouth her name when asked by a therapist and take sips of water.   Towards the end of the week she mouthed the words, “I love you” to her husband and reached for his arm.  To the family this was their miracle that only God could have done, and I am once again reminded that each day is an incredible gift and we should rejoice and be glad in the love of our Heavenly Father.</p><p><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p>Dear Heavenly Father, thank you so much for this day and the beauty that comes with it.  We are so grateful for you and for your healing and for the lessons of love that you teach us through all kinds of situations.  We are humbled by your power and your grace and we honor you above all things.  In your precious name we pray, AMEN. </p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1585664979960-FX54CLHP9HFT61IC19JJ/john-jennings-IcT8l8DDek8-unsplash.jpg,324
325,Searching for Love in All The Wrong Places,post,2020-02-18 14:00:00,,/blogfeed/2020/3/30/searching-for-love-in-all-the-wrong-places,<p>This blog was written by Laurie Crookenden.</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Readings:  <br/>1 John 4: 16-</strong> We have come to know [by personal observation and experience], and have believed [with deep, consistent faith] the love which God has for us. <strong>God is love</strong>, and the one who abides in love, abides in God, and God abides continually in him. (I love the amplified version when I am studying because it helps me really see and understand some of the hidden meaning of the words that might get lost in translation.)</p><p><strong>Exodus 20: 2-3</strong>- I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. You shall have no other gods before me. </p><p><strong>Psalm 103: 2, 4</strong>- Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits… who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy.</p><p>My personal experience with God has stretched over years at this point. The marvelous thing is that it never gets old and He guides our relationship deeper and deeper from one experience to another as I place my trust in Him more with each passing year and phase of life. When I was younger, I thought a person would fulfill my need for love. As a child it was my dad, as a young woman, my husband. These two men are such great influences on my life and I am grateful God gave them to me; but as I live and learn, I realize the God shaped vacuum in my heart is too big for them to fill and too powerful for me to ignore the real Father and lover of my soul who desires to fill that space. </p><p>I also think that our society throws the word “love” around all too casually. We can talk about loving chocolate and family in the same breath. One way that I see love exercised is with trust. Can we trust that thing we love to bring us joy, happiness, restoration, life? Is that thing or person trustworthy? Putting too much value on anything outside of God cannot fill that place of longing in our hearts. For a while, I think I even tried looking for love from my career. Thinking it made me more of a person, more worthy or worthwhile somehow. As a nurse I gained a lot of my sense of worth from helping people. I thought I was in the right place. Turns out I was wrong. </p><p>God relocated my husband and me here to Virginia just over a year ago. The uprooting I felt made me again realize I was searching in wrong places. Out of a sense of longing for a grandchild we answered the call to help in Kidspoint. How blessed we have been to be preparing to be grandparents while loving the kids here in our new community! Even being a grandparent will not fulfill our deep need for love.</p><p>I feel a little like Dorothy in Oz. I am not in Kansas, never was. But I always had the power to return home, if that return was to God. He empowers me every day to seek Him first, put Him first and to trust Him in all things. I can try to search my own way and get lost in the process. Or, I can trust Him to draw me to His perfect love and plan for my life. </p><p><strong>Prayer:<br/></strong>Father God, you are love. You set me free from a life of slavery. I am so grateful for the people and places you have put in my life that point the way to you. I am thankful for your equipping me to touch peoples’ lives in my career and family. Help me to always abide in you and lean on you and your ways for understanding. Let me not get distracted by the good things you give to me as benefits. Help me to always put you first. Amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1585623512036-6Q3U9BOIEC10XB3S0LE8/drew-graham-_Sr03VSKIeg-unsplash.jpg,326
327,For Such a Time as This,post,2020-03-31 13:00:00,,/blogfeed/2020/3/31/for-such-a-time-as-this,<p>Today’s blog was written by Mary Hannah Dolan.</p>,"<p><strong>Today’s Reading:</strong> <br/> “Who knows but that you have come to royal position for such a time as this?” (Esther 4: 14b). </p><p>Loss. Fear. Loneliness. These are a few of the emotions that come to mind as I ponder the ramifications that the coronavirus has had on my life and the lives of my friends and family. Some of you reading this may have lost your jobs, or even loved ones as a result of the virus. I often allow myself to become fearful considering the toll this disease has taken on our healthcare system, or how it may affect my parents. Finally, the loneliness related to social distancing seems unbearable some days, even for an introvert like myself. </p><p>In all of this COVID-19 chaos, the Lord has been comforting me through the character of Esther. A Jewish girl who lived in Persia during the reign of King Xerxes, Esther’s life suddenly changed due to circumstances completely beyond her control; she was brought to the royal palace to become part of King Xerxes’s harem. Like us, Esther experienced loss, fear, and loneliness as her friends were probably not as accessible and her religious customs were seemingly obliterated. In addition to all of Esther’s personal fears, her people, the Jews, were to be terminated by Haman, a noble in service of King Xerxes. Esther was faced with a grim ultimatum: she could watch her people be executed while she kept silent, or she could risk her life by going to the king without an invitation to plead for the lives of her people. As Esther labored in her decision, her cousin, Mordecai, posed the question, “Who knows but that you have come to royal position for such a time as this?” (Esther 4:14b).</p><p>Though the words of Mordecai were applied to Esther during a specific time in history, I believe that we too have been placed in this frightening, foreign time “for such a time as this.” In His omniscience, the Lord knew the time and dates that COVID-19 would occur, and in His wisdom has perfectly placed us in the middle of it to “shine as stars in the sky, blameless and pure” (Philippians 2:15). Let us not lose hope, brothers and sisters. I don’t know what the Lord has in store for us in our version of Esther’s story, but what I do know is that He has given us the opportunity to join Him in saving His people . . . our friends and neighbors who need a Savior, just like the Jews in Esther’s story.  “Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season, we will reap a harvest if we do not give up” (Galatians 6:9).    </p><p><strong>Prayer:<br/></strong>Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, let me be like Esther, making the decision to cast fear aside and look to you though she did not know the outcome. Give us faith to help save your people in “such a time as this.” </p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1585669015745-Z8NFJSMSPNPYAAICRYNS/artem-maltsev-aSscHG6lvko-unsplash.jpg,328

Amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1585667919912-6KGJ1HXT0BONDZ4CY1QJ/joshua-earle-JAwzCW0JpIw-unsplash.jpg,330

In Christ, we are relaxed and at peace in the midst of confusions, bewilderments, and perplexities of this life. The storm rages, but our hearts are at rest.”</p><p>Scripture reminds us all of the story of Gideon and the anxiety he must have felt when God asked him to deliver the children of Israel. But the Lord spoke the words we all need to hear these words in Judges 6:16: ""I will be with you!""</p><p>With all that's happening daily, being self-employed and having employees that have been with me as long as 30 years, it is easier to invite something like worry or fear into your mindset. Some of these employees have become like family. God taught me years ago how to recognize and understand worry and fear as being incompatible with answered prayer. The enemy is a master at deceiving us all in very seductive ways. I pray we all put on the full armor of God – <em>first thing </em>every morning and then throughout the day.  By doing this, we can recognize quicker and will be prepared to rebuke the enemy's attempts to instill worry or fear.  </p><p>We all see and hear of new things daily that can cause fear and worry, knowing they are perhaps as threatening and unsettling as anything we’ve ever seen.  That's what I love about God's living and breathed Word. We can feed on it like manna from heaven!!  </p><p>Jeremiah 29:11-12 is a scripture passage we all know well, and yet every time I read it, I smile! “For I know the plans I have for you,"" declares the Lord, ""plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you.”  Thank You Father God! </p><p><strong>Prayer:</strong></p><p>Father God, help us to keep our eyes fixed on Jesus each day as we walk and talk with the King of Kings.  Thank you for Your Word and for the reassurance of its truth – for today and every day.  May the promise of Your presence bring us peace as the storm rages, for in You our hearts find rest.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1585666995570-8DU786UEJ4UN7NK28YNU/andre-benz-sLokLIacItI-unsplash.jpg,332
333,Quarantine Encouragement From a Professional,post,2020-04-21 14:00:00,,/blogfeed/2020/4/22/quarantine-encouragement-from-a-professional,<p>This blog was written by Della Anne Gallagher.</p>,"<p>Scripture Reading: “I am acting with great boldness toward you; I have great pride in you; I am filled with comfort. In all our affliction, I am overflowing with joy.” (2 Corinthians 7:4) </p><p>These days it seems like you can’t avoid affliction, even when forced to shelter in place. With all the news, loneliness, and even tensions inside your own home it can be hard to find the joy. It’s important to be aware, be smart, be safe, and be kind (to yourself and others). These are tough times for all, but working together (even from afar) can be a huge help to everyone. I’m not a CDC or biblical expert, but I do know that being smart, considerate, and faithful will get us through this. And feeling panic, fear, concern, anxiety, etc. is normal and okay. God gave us feelings and common sense for a reason. God is in control. But it’s how we deal with it and treat ourselves and others that is in our control. Y’all can do it! So as someone who does social distancing for a living (thanks to a few chronic illnesses) I wanted to share some tips that can help you find some comfort, stability, and hopefully joy in this unknown time. </p><p>-Keep with the daily hygiene and routine sleep schedule. </p><p>-Stay hydrated. </p><p>-Step outside/Get in the car and leave the house. </p><p>-Put electronics on silence, it’s good to step away from all the news and alerts for some time. </p><p>-Acknowledge what you’re grateful for daily. </p><p>-Reach out to folks during this time/Join a small group via video chat. </p><p>-Don’t do everything in one day...spread out your “to do” list throughout the week. </p><p>-Now’s a good time to read a book, study a book of the bible, check out a podcast or a TV streaming service, etc. </p><p>-Prayer, meditation, and yoga are helpful to slow down and relax the mind. </p><p>-Foster an animal from the local shelter/offer to walk an elderly or sick person’s pup. </p><p>-If everyone is healthy and safe, offer to help someone who may not be able to leave the house. </p><p>Prayer: “Heavenly Father, we know that all things work together for your good.

335,Listen to His Voice,post,2020-05-20 05:03:28,,/blogfeed/2020/5/20/listen-to-his-voice,<p>This blog was written by Jonathan Hickory.</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading: </strong>My child, we will go together, and I will be your Guide. I will be “the Light unto your feet and the Lamp unto your path.” (Psalm 119:105)</p><p></p><p>A couple of days ago, my 3 year old son terrified my wife and me when he hopped on his little balance bike, locked his gaze on the horizon, and took off out of the driveway and down the street. Our 10 year old daughter and our 14 year old nephew had just left a few minutes prior on a bike ride, but they were well out of sight.</p><p>My 7 months pregnant wife was in no position to run after him, and she called out to him in vain as he blazed a trail into the sunset. I was outside at the time and heard the commotion, and a split second later I was tearing through the front yard, hot on his heels—or wheels.</p><p>I yelled at him to stop, some obvious desperation in my voice. But my voice fell on deaf ears as my determined little fellow only seemed to pick up speed as he rolled down the dangerous street.</p><p>Thankfully, there were no cars anywhere around on a road where the speed limit is 40 MPH. As I finally caught up to him, I could see the determined look in his eyes as his little legs pushed him further down the street.</p><p>I finally was able to run past him and stop him in his tracks. You know that moment, the overwhelming emotion running through you as you search for words? There I was, grabbing a firm hold of his handle bars as I jumped in front of his little blue bike.</p><p>“Buddy, you can’t just go into the road without Momma or Daddy!! You have to have someone with you!”</p><p>His fists clenched around his little handlebars, his eyes filled with fury almost looking through me, his cheeks burning with anger, huge crocodile tears began to fall as he choked out, “You are BLOCKING my WAY!”</p><p>I sat with him and talked with him for a minute, embracing him as he stood on his little balance bike on the side of the road.</p><p>I asked him if he wanted me to go with him so he could go for a bike ride, and through his tears he finally nodded yes. We took off down the road together, me running next to him as he continued his dire mission to find his sister and cousin, and join them.</p><p>Many times we take off on our own, without God. He pleads with us, even raises His voice at us, as we blaze further down the road away from Him. As we further recklessly endanger ourselves and push down our own path, He pursues us, ultimately jumping in front of us and stopping us in our tracks. We don’t understand, we clench our fists and burn with anger and confusion. WHY God?</p><p>Have you ever heard His voice after you have taken off without Him? Have you ever looked back and seen how He had tried to stop you gently, tried to show you the way? Have you ever wished you had heeded God’s voice, and maybe the hardship and the destruction in your life could have been avoided?</p><p>Walk with the Lord and seek His guidance, and He will walk with you as you honor His will for your life.</p><p></p><p><strong>Prayer:  </strong>Heavenly Father, guide my path as I walk with you daily.  Help me to know Your will for my life.  Amen. </p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1589951322925-CLGVTP4SXQIUBCG4X7XB/AboyandhisBike.jpg,336
337,Gratitude in Times of Uncertainty,post,2020-05-05 14:00:00,,/blogfeed/2020/5/8/gratitude-in-times-of-uncertainty,<p>This blog was written by Kelly Dampier.</p>,"<p>If there’s one thing I’ve learned in the past two months, it would have to be the hard lesson of being content in the here and now. I’m the OG of FOMO (fear of missing out) , and I tend to look backwards in regret and also forwards in anticipation. It breeds anxiety in my life, like major anxiety, and it’s something that I dealt with even as a child.</p><p>I can’t say I’ve eliminated any of it, or some magic stardust floated down and *poof* I’m cured, but this whole thing has caused me to slow my roll. Gratitude like every single day. Even the days that feel like everything is combusting. </p><p>I love this sacred space we’ve created as a family and that’s growing in me these past 8 weeks. Its something that has been missing in me for quite awhile, and I’m finding it again. This time has gone by so quickly, and it’s definitely not ending super fast...but life must move forward. Bit by bit we will leave the bunkers and embrace each other and exclaim, “We made it! We are the lucky ones.” I can say that I’m walking into it all changed, and um, maybe a bit raw? Aren’t we all? Yea, I think we’re all just tender right now.</p><p>I hope my girls look back one day and say, “We weren’t scared, but we were safe so that others could be safe. We were on top of each other’s personal space, and we fought like every day, but we grew closer than ever in love and understanding. Family walks, and birds building nests on our porch, learning how to bake, and mom teaching us subtraction and the art of handwritten letters, are things we want to pass on to our own families. We learned a lot about how God provides, and how blessed we are. We miss those quarantine days. They made us.”  💗</p><p>Prayer:</p><p>Lord, in a world of vast unknowns please remind us what it feels like to slow down and be in Your presence. When we truly appreciate the moment, the day, the very hour that you have given us, it changes our perspective. Holy Spirit move us to gratitude. Shift our hearts from fear and anxiety, to peace and gratefulness. We love you. We are so thankful to have gotten another day here, with those we love.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1588960786452-Q1LUOU6RF9FXVX2AEF25/kellsocialpost+copy.jpg,338
339,Bigger Than I Thought You Were,post,2020-06-16 13:00:00,,/blogfeed/2020/6/17/bigger-than-i-thought-you-were,<p>This blog was written by Emily Clay.</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading</strong></p><p> “Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise; His greatness no one can fathom.” – Psalm 145:3</p><p>Lately I’ve been thanking God that He is immeasurable and incomprehensible. He has no limits; He is unable to be fully known; He is an infinite mystery. </p><p>Earlier this year I suffered a serious injury that had me bedridden for weeks. I don’t know how I got hurt. The doctors don’t know how I got hurt. How can I literally not be able to stand up or drive or shower and no one know the cause?! Here’s the truth: God knows me full well. While the chiropractor, my parents and friends, and myself try to understand, God doesn’t try. He made me and He is intimately familiar with me. He knows exactly what went wrong and how it happened, and He knows exactly what I need to heal. While I am limited in my knowing, God is not. And this truth creates peace in my heart. I do not know myself fully nor can I, but I do know the one who knows me fully and He is good and He is trustworthy. So, in my limitedness I acknowledge and praise my limitless Papa. </p><p>To say I can know God fully would imply that He has limits and can be measured and that would somehow place God not above me, as He is, but beside me. It’s not that He isn’t able to be known but that He is so unlimited in Himself that it is impossible to know Him fully. All throughout the Bible, God consistently and constantly affirms He knows his creations better than we know ourselves. For example, God’s reply to Job in Job 38-41 and Jesus’ reply to the woman at the well in John 4. This vastness of God should cause us to tremble. But we can also find peace and assurance that God is fully good so all that we don’t know about Him is fully good too. God doesn’t have skeletons in His closet, but I guess if He did, they would only be good and pure and beautiful.  </p><p>For the past two years I have been asking God to <em>blow to my mind</em> and I find myself more and more these days praising Him, “Wow, God, You are so much bigger than I thought You were.” God wouldn’t be much of a “god” if we were able to mark his boundaries or if we could grasp all of who He is. God is so much bigger than we think and so much bigger than we know and that’s a good thing because it reminds us that He is God and we are not. </p><p><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p>God who is immeasurable, You are more than I thought You were. You continually do things outside my imagination. Your ways are higher and Your thoughts are higher. Thank-you for your specific and complete care of me. You see me. You know me. Help me to think on You and of You rightly. Increase my faith that I might not underestimate You. Amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1592400528590-YFDOTYO11TFTMGDG444V/bigger.jpg,340
341,It’s OK to not be OK,post,2020-06-02 13:00:00,,/blogfeed/2020/6/2/its-ok-to-not-be-ok,<p>This blog was written by Allison Poindexter.</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading:  </strong>“But he answered me, “My grace is always more than enough for you, and my power finds its full expression through your weakness.” So I will celebrate my weaknesses, for when I’m weak I sense more deeply the mighty power of Christ living in me.”  2 Corinthians 12:9</p><p>Sitting in my office on March 13, I watched, stunned, as the Governor closed all Virginia schools for two weeks, and I tried to wrap my brain around what the break from school would look like for me, my daughter, and my family.  I wrote a schedule for our days: up and showered by 9, bible study together at the dining room table, English or Algebra work, exercise outside, and chores.  There would be a family lunch, a break time, followed by more school.  We would make dinner together, wind down for the evening, and go to bed by 10.  I threw the schedule away by the second day. I think my early attempts at controlling the experience of pandemic for my family speaks to a greater faith issue I’ve uncovered in myself.  I don’t trust God to be in control, so I try to be.</p><p>It didn’t take long before my attempts at control utterly failed.  I just wasn’t able to orchestrate an Instagram-worthy quarantine.  I found I couldn’t bear the sound of the television, so we listened to worship music on repeat - sometimes the same song, over and over.  I didn’t learn how to bake bread.  I completely lost my cool with my daughter and slammed every door between the garage and my bedroom.  I couldn’t stay on top of my own transition to working from home while managing my daughter’s academic load, too.  So I didn’t.</p><p>Instead, our pandemic has been slow and quiet.  We’ve been walking down our country road daily and slowed down enough to notice the change from winter to spring. We watched as daffodils bloomed, then tulips, irises, and now peonies and honeysuckle.  We noticed trees flowering and the birds who live in our backyard.  We’ve sat on the porch together, watching our neighbors bale hay.  We’ve called friends and Zoomed and laughed and cried.  </p><p>It’s almost a cliché to say this now.  But I’ve learned that it’s OK to not be OK.  God doesn’t need me to be high functioning in the middle of a global pandemic.  My family is going to be OK if we don’t get out of our pajamas, if we eat salsa for lunch, if we’re still up watching Netflix at 11 PM.  My relationship with my daughter is going to survive the pandemic even if I hide in my room and lock the door for a couple hours.  I’m still an awesome woman of God if I dwell on one line of scripture every day instead of using this time to deep dive into Ephesians.  I’m still a great employee if I need to establish and enforce boundaries about how long I will devote my attention in a Zoom meeting or when I’ll respond to an email.  If I need more help, in the form of counseling, that’s OK, too.  </p><p>In fact, God’s goodness, mercy, and power are more precious and obvious when my attempts at control have finally frayed.  I’m so grateful for the evidence I’ve seen, over and over, of how God has been orchestrating my peace in the midst of this season, coordinating precious moments of laughter for me and my daughter, giving me moments of silence when I’m overwhelmed with the noise of news and commentary.  </p><p>As we transition to a life after this pandemic, I pray that I won’t forget these lessons.  I pray that I won’t step back into the life I had before without really considering the cost to my peace.</p><p><strong>Prayer:  </strong>Lord, you have our attention. Please, Lord, reveal to us what you would have us take away from this season. Show us what we need to leave in our “pre-pandemic” lives.  Show us what we need more of in our lives now. Be ever present, Lord, and teach us how to be more like You.  </p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1592400976902-WHPFKTHQ35R0RJ6QY9TA/itsok.jpg,342
343,The Wanderers,post,2020-06-30 14:00:00,,/blogfeed/2020/7/13/the-wanderers,<p>This blog post was written by Krista Varanyak.</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading:</strong><em> </em>“In a desert land he found him, in a barren and howling waste. He shielded him and cared for him; he guarded him as the apple of his eye.”<em> </em>Deuteronomy 32:10</p><p>I made my choice for college on “Decision Day”, the last day possible to make the decision. One month after graduating from college, I accepted an assistantship for graduate school just as I was leaving for vacation. More recently, I accepted a contract for my current job in Charlottesville on the Fourth of July in 2017, without even visiting, and just about a month before the position was set to start. Prior to all of these monumental decisions, and many smaller ones in between, I wondered if I was making the right choice because I had other carefully thought out plans. That is the problem, though, when I look at my journey through this perspective- it isn’t really about my plans. Time and time again, God was directing and protecting me while I took my sweet time getting to where I am today- geographically and spiritually. </p><p>Thankfully, while in graduate school, after a semester of feeling particularly lost, I decided to attend a Christian service and gave my life to Christ that day. I wish I could say that was the end of my wandering, but as you can tell from the story above, I continued to resist what God had for me. I finally made it to Charlottesville, attended The Point in the first few weeks, got connected to a group soon after, and the rest is God. I consider The Point my home and often think “If only I had come sooner.” Here’s the thing- I almost applied to graduate school at UVA, but God knew I wasn’t ready to be there yet.</p><p>When I think back over the past few years, I think of myself like the wandering Israelites. They were so close to the Promised Land, yet continued to doubt, disobey, and put their faith into things other than God. Yet through all of their wandering, God did not abandon them. Moses reminds the Israelites of this as they are about to enter Canaan: God protected them, provided for them, and continued to fulfill his promises. Unfortunately, for the Israelites, entering the Promised Land was not the end of the story. They continued to sin, which led to destruction. Fortunately for them and us, God STILL kept His promises by sending Jesus to serve as the ultimate sacrifice for sin. </p><p>We should take comfort in the fact, that despite all of our wandering, doubt, and sin, God keeps the promises to us as well. He finds us in pits of despair, dragging our feet in disobedience, or hopelessly wandering pursuing our plans. Even still, He gives us comfort and guidance and will lead us to the Promised Land.</p><p><strong>Reflection:  </strong>What are you allowing to keep you from God’s promises? Where do you need to obey and trust God’s plan over your own?</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1594665175011-EXSQBDE6DIWBGNFEI5AD/57662.jpg,344
345,Unity,post,2020-07-28 14:00:00,,/blogfeed/2020/7/28/unity,<p>This blog was written by Melody Criswell.</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading:</strong>""By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.”  (John 13:35)</p><p>There is something in the Holy Week story that always takes my breath away.  Everything was getting ready to shift into high gear, and every moment counted as Jesus knew exactly when He would be arrested… This was a KAIROS moment of all KAIROS moments, and the clock was counting down.  Jesus prayed a very specific intercessory prayer in some of His last moments of “freedom”.  VERY specific, because Jesus was and is ALWAYS very specific.</p><p>And the final part of His penultimate “private” intercessory prayer — the long one before His final brief one in the Garden — before His arrest — was for US.</p><p>(The first time I ever read John 17, as a new Christian over 45 years ago; I marveled, “Wow, Jesus prayed this for Me!”  Because that’s what John 17:20 says… For ME!)</p><p>YOU and ME.</p><p>TODAY.  RIGHT NOW.</p><p>WE WERE ON HIS MIND.</p><p>And He prayed ONE THING, over and over.</p><p>You Bible students KNOW that from Genesis to Revelation — when God or Jesus REPEATS SOMETHING — that’s a BIG “HEADS UP.”   John 17 is the longest recorded prayer that we have from Jesus.  It is deeply significant. </p><p>First, Jesus sought God for Himself; next, He prayed for His disciples.  Then, the final six verses of the chapter were for all future believers.</p><p>He prayed hard for UNITY as Christians. As far as I can tell from the text, He prayed at least FOUR TIMES for unity:  that we would all be one, just as He and His Father are One.  He did not pray for prominence, or governmental power, or money, or favor, or easy lives. Out of everything He could pray for, He prayed over and over for UNITY. Because He surely knew that we were going to need it.</p><p>Warren Wiersbe said of John 17: “The disciples had often exhibited a spirit of selfishness, competition, and disunity, and this must’ve broken the Saviour’s heart.”</p><p>It still does.</p><p>We are RELATED.  WAY deeper than DNA, we are ONE.  DNA is physical and temporal; our relationship as believers is spiritual and eternal.  There is no “us” and “them”.  Since I am a Christian, I have to find a way to let that one go. A root of bitterness, no matter how “justified”, is never justified in God’s eyes.  Gary M. Burge says, “Jesus envisages a profound spiritual intimacy that changes human life.”</p><p>It is part of the hard work of sanctification in each believer’s heart, to seek out any bitter roots and hand them over to God.  Any unforgiveness, bias, meanness, unfairness, prejudice; any thing that we “hold on to”, we have to give to God for Him to remove the bitter root and cleanse our hearts and tell us what to do.  Across family divisions, generations, races, cultures, politics… It’s way more than a two-way street because it applies to every believer in all directions; but it so intimately centers on each of us and God. </p><p>HE DIED TO MAKE US ONE.  I kneel for that, and I lock arms for that, and I stand for that.  Maranatha.  Come, Lord Jesus.</p><p><strong>Prayer:  </strong>Father, begin with me.  In this volatile, confusing world, search in my own heart for any bitter roots, which defile many and from which You have promised each of us a way of escape.   Lord, I might “look okay” to the whole world, but I want to look right to YOU.  Expose what I need to see, and help me to deal with it thoroughly; exactly as You command.  Look across all my relationships: family, friends, work, church, neighbors, community… across political and racial and cultural lines; show me any biases and meanness and unkindness in my own heart… If I need to make amends — show me how, and let me be quick to do so.  If I need to forgive someone even if they do not seek forgiveness — let me be quick and thorough to do so.  Father, sometimes this is overwhelming and might even seem “unfair” and maybe “too much to ask”; and yet You insist… Help me to loosen my death grip on anything that I need to let go of; to hold that heavy thing lightly in my hand and give it all into Your Hands, over and over, as many times as it takes — until it is done forever and there is total freedom and peace with You.  “Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts.  See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the everlasting way.” (Psalm 139:23-24)</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1596172011224-5S0SEIQQN98862RT6LDJ/10.7_SQ.jpg,346
347,Blank Canvas,post,2020-07-14 14:00:00,,/blogfeed/2020/7/31/blank-canvas,<p>This blog was written by Kathy Carpenter.</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading:  - </strong>""When I consider Thy heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars which Thou hast fixed; O Lord, our Lord, How majestic is Thy name in all the earth!""<strong> </strong>Psalm 8:3 and 9</p><p><br/>Funny Story, when I was asked if I’d like to share some thoughts, a catchy title came to mind. I soon realized that I’d unintentionally plagiarized it from a lesson series. Somewhat discouraged it occurred to me that I was then working with a blank canvas…<br/><br/>But the truth is God has given us all the brushes, paints and scenery we could ever need. He always does that, doesn't He? The foundation is Jesus. Luke 6:46-49 and Matthew 7:24-27 explain the difference between just hearing His Words and hearing and acting upon them. When we hear and obey we've built our ""house"" with a deep foundation which rests on the rock. In Matthew 16:18 Jesus said He would build His church on the rock, which is the fact that Jesus is ""the Christ, the Son of the living God."" (v16)<br/><br/>So we know we have the foundation for everything - Jesus our Savior. And in knowing Him we learn to experience joy from using the gifts He's given us to serve Him by serving others. The canvas is getting full and colorful now, right?<br/><br/>I had a ""blank canvas"" experience about four months ago when we were all caught off guard and found ourselves in quarantine. My full calendar was suddenly empty and I became discouraged... loneliness, lack of purpose, fear of the unknown... feelings not unique to me, yet very real and personal. But fast forward and I find that while I still don't understand the ""what,"" ""when,"" ""why,"" ""where"" and ""how"" of it all, I'm trusting more fully each day the ""Who."" I'm so grateful to know ""Who"" wasn't caught off guard; ""Who"" can make dinner for thousands from a few loaves of bread and a couple fish; ""Who"" has been in control since before the beginning of time; and ""Who"" loved us so much that He sent His Son to die in our place, then raised Him from the dead just as He had promised.<br/><br/>I love what Cara Whitney (Larry the Cable Guy's wife) says, ""Comprehending God's plan can wait, obeying God's will cannot."" Now she didn't write that little nugget during a global pandemic, but that's when I read it and that was no accident.</p><p>So the One who placed the moon and the stars in the sky and created beautiful landscape scenes that we enjoy everyday ensures that we're never working from a blank canvas. We have everything we need to be the artists He created us to be.<br/><br/><strong>Prayer: </strong>Dear Lord, help us to remember Your promise that Your grace is sufficient. Help us to fully trust You with every facet of our lives and to understand more everyday just how much You love each and every one of us.  In Jesus' Name. Amen</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1596171751833-8GFN7VOI86LW91VQPQX1/justyn-warner-VH8w75u3LE0-unsplash.jpg,348
349,Good Reception,post,2020-08-11 13:00:00,,/blogfeed/2020/8/17/good-reception,<p>This blog was written by Tom Russman.</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading</strong>:  ""We love because he first loved us."" 1 John 4:19. </p><p>I need to hear this just now and at many other times.  I know the two great commandments of the Law, the commandments to love God with all I have and am and to love my neighbor as myself.  And I know that the standard goes even higher in the ""new commandment"" Jesus gives us: that I am to love my fellow Christians, who are in Christ with me and know God, not just as I love myself, but as Jesus loves them.  And I truly long to love God--and my brothers and sisters in Christ--that way.  </p><p>I can hear these great commandments and wonder how I may get a grip on such a high standard for my own life.  Perhaps I doubt that it is possible.  Of course, I know I can never equal the love of Jesus himself!  And He is not asking me to do the impossible, he who knows my limitations better than I know them.  But clearly by stating these commandments in the way he does, Jesus wants and calls me to aspire greatly, to aim very high indeed.  How can I practically even start to do that?  Am I making a key mistake that holds me back? </p><p>""We love because he first loved us.""  This clearly tells me that I must first receive God's love before I can become good at giving love.  Receiving love is prior to giving love. And I must receive God's love fully, abundantly, voraciously so that he can elevate my capacity to love.  Otherwise, I start to notice that my love is weaker than I know it might be.  I need to sit in the Lord's presence and ask that his abundant love and grace fall upon me and inundate my being.  This is delightful to do and gives joy to my spirit.  It is a prayer for the Holy Spirit that Jesus said our heavenly Father will not refuse.  Why am I so slow to simply bask in the Lord's love and grace?  It is the fountain of all that is best in my life. </p><p>Perhaps I fail at this partly because of another Scripture that I hear so often: ""It is better to give than to receive.""  In Acts 20:35 Paul gives this dictum as a  saying of Jesus.  It seems to mandate that I should focus more on giving than on receiving.  But here I need to go deeper or I will trip.  Of course, it is better to give than to receive--and the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are infinitely ""better"" than I am!  And so my truest relationship with them will mostly be their giving and my receiving!  And I need to embrace this with all my heart fully to receive the abundance of their love and grace.  This is what I want and this I pray for unabashedly.  Only when I love with the love he gives me do I have any hope of loving my brothers and sisters as Jesus loves them.  </p><p>And this is the final key for me.  I need to be deeply humble before my Lord; I need  to acknowledge that I am his poor and humble servant.  Without him I am utterly destitute.  I need to see this over and over.  With him I can be rich far beyond my imagination.  If I am not humble, I will not ask for much!  I have to be very humble to ask unstintingly for the abundance of his love and grace--over and over again--and receive it--over and over again!  </p><p><strong>Prayer:  </strong>Lord, I prostrate myself before you as your poor and humble servant.  Forgive my sins.  Pour into me the full abundance of your love and grace.  Give me a mind and heart ready to receive them.  And carve a deep channel in my being so that your very love may flow out of me in love for my brothers and sisters.  I ask in Jesus' name.  Amen.      </p><p> </p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1597692640667-2PC1D6DXTVS28K9AOM3O/reception.jpg,350
351,Take Heart,post,2020-09-08 04:00:00,,/blogfeed/2020/9/2/5pqcnh3dine2ns2y1urea2k7apm50k,<p>This blog was written by Marvin Scoggin.</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading: </strong><em>“. </em>. . this very night there stood before me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship. . . . <strong>take heart</strong> . . . for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told.” Acts 27:23, 25</p><p>I always hated when someone told me after some bad decision, “I told you so.”  My in-the-head reply:  “Yeah, whatever; too late for that now, and you're not helping.”  But if someone said, ""There's still hope,"" they had my ear!</p><p>Paul became that person to the crew and passengers on his “cruise” to Rome (Acts 27:1-28:16).  He was appealing his case to Caesar.  (The Jews of Jerusalem wanted this troublemaker dead.)  Winds were contrary on every leg of the journey, and despite every skilled effort by pilot and crew—hugging the shoreline, staying on the lee side of islands—it was very slow-going.  They tried dipping down to Crete, a long, narrow island in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea.  With much difficulty, they finally made it to Fair Haven, a harbor midway along Crete’s southern coast.  </p><p>Paul warned those in charge not to try sailing farther.  Autumn and its treacherous weather were upon them.  But the centurion in charge chose to listen to the pilot and the ship’s owner:  Press on to a more suitable harbor.  Finally, a good breeze came.  They gambled on reaching Phoenix at the far western edge of Crete, just 45 miles and a much better place to hole up for winter.  But no sooner had they set out than a fierce, blasting wind came from land to shore, blowing them out to sea—“reasonable risk” turned “bad bet.”  Ever tried leaping across a stream and realized, too late, that it's six inches wider than your best jump?</p><p>So it was here:  This ill-advised decision cast them into storm-tossed seas that forced them to jettison cargo, then the ship’s tackle, and, finally, all hope of being saved.  They bobbed around for two weeks under dark skies, so occupied with surviving that they didn’t even eat.  Then Paul told the others, “Take heart!” which could be translated, ""Cheer up!"" (Acts 27:22 &amp; 25).  He learned from an angel of God how it would turn out:  All 276 would survive, but the ship would be lost.  In the following hours, the ship lodged on a reef and was dashed to pieces, but everyone made it to shore and, ultimately, to Rome.</p><p>We, too, are sometimes subject to circumstances beyond our control or consequences of decisions by others, whether the pilot of a storm-tossed plane, an errant Uber driver, the drunken driver barreling toward a light that turned red for him but green for you, or the unwitting carrier of a virus.  As Paul said to his hopeless companions, take heart—cheer up!  We may not receive angelic assurances in the current circumstance, but we know with certainty, by faith, how it all turns out.  It’s no gamble to trust our God, who delivered us from darkness to light, death to life, hopelessness to assurance of salvation and eternal life.  Our prayer, both now and from now on, can be, </p><p><strong><em>""Dear Father, the God to whom I belong and whom I worship, Your will be done, Your good purpose be fulfilled in my life and the lives of those dear to me.  Thank You now and forever.  Amen.""</em></strong></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1599100036795-3JGKS7AYLWQ8ULKIH8RG/IMG_5456.png,352
353,Staying Positive in a World that’s Increasingly Negative,post,2020-08-25 04:00:00,,/blogfeed/2020/9/2/iuyoaaobvny8j4b36hmofzdddgrzv5,<p>This blog was written by Val Race.</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading:  </strong>A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones. Proverbs 17: 22</p><p>Part of being happy is having and maintaining a positive attitude.  I thank God for being a God of delivered promises.  He never said our lives would be easy, but He promised He would walk beside us and carry our burdens if we let Him.</p><p>My earliest memories of being positive were ones reinforced by my mom.  Simply put, we were not allowed to be negative! When mom went on her “being positive” rant, we glued our mouths shut, focused our eyes on her and took our tough love.  After our lecture we said “Yes ma’am” and then retreated to our rooms. You bet there was eye rolling and sticking our tongues out when shecouldn’t see us! Just because I was taught to be positive doesn’t mean that it was easy, nor did I always want to be.  It’s really a life-long practice that leads to joy and contentment. Any habit worth cultivating requires practice and do-overs, over and over again!  Here are a few things that have made me more successful in maintaining a positive attitude.</p><p>1. Spend time with God daily and pray about anything and everything.  Ask God to change your heart and mind.  Several years ago I attended a Point Women’s Day and we were given a key and chain to remind us to allow God free access to our heart and to unlock any doors for him to enter and create heart change.  Since then that key hangs from my car mirror. Every time I am in my car I am reminded of this. I hold the key and tell God it is his and to use it and create the heart in me He wants.  </p><p>2. Do a 30 day thankful/grateful journal.  Each day write 3 things you are thankful or grateful for. Meditate and pray thanks over them. I did this 3 years ago inDecember and that journaling changed my life for the better.  I found I was blessed beyond belief!</p><p>3. Change your dialogue.  “I can’t” becomes “I will”.  “I have to” becomes “I get to” and I really use this one, usually every Monday!  I find myself saying I don’t want to go to work today.  Quickly I change that to I get to go to work today!  I get up and dressed in a cozy home with clothes to choose from and I get to jump in a car with gas to go and serve where I work.  I have an opportunity to make a difference in someone’s life by showing a positive attitude and having a merry heart!</p><p>4. If you are able, set aside a little piece of change each month to give away.  I just started this January 2020.  It allows me to give a small blessing to someone I know, don’t know, or to a favorite charity.  It gives me an opportunity to speak life into another person,allows me to love my neighbor and share the blessings God has given to me. If your finances don’t allow, look for service opportunities in your community.  Your time can be just what someone may need.</p><p>I’m thankful for my parents who practiced tough love on me.  It may have taken years for me to realize their wisdom and the gifts that produced.  I’m thankful for times when I had poor health, God has completely healed me.  He is not finished with me and he is not finished with you!  If you need some further verses for thought see: Prov15:15, 1 Tim 6:6, Is 55:12, Ps 16:11, Neh 8:10.</p><p><strong>Prayer:  </strong>Father God, Thank you for showing me that positivity is a journey and not a destination.  Help me to focus on what you have provided and given to me.  May I always see my cup as full, running over with your blessings.  Help me to always offer a smile, a kind word and a helping hand to others.  May who you are be reflected in my actions. Amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1599099784177-TOPKZNATGL45DVPQTGUY/IMG_5455.png,354
355,Freedom from the Mindset of Captivity,post,2021-01-21 17:45:46,,/blogfeed/2021/1/11/freedom-from-the-mindset-of-captivity,,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading: </strong>“If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and are overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning.” 2 Peter 2:20</p><p>I learned several years ago that having a “mindset of freedom” went along hand-in-hand with living a life of freedom, however, I also came to realize that one could definitely exist without the other; we can be deemed free by knowing Christ Jesus and accepting Him as our Lord and Savior, but still have the mindset and actions of a captive. I was saved at the age of 33, after I entered into a discipleship/rehabilitation program. Before going into the program, I had struggled with addiction for twenty-two years, not to mention my childhood that was filled with deep hurt and trauma. So, by the time I had come to the end of myself, I was physically and mentally shackled to addiction, negative thinking, and to the ways of the world. I knew exactly what it meant to live according to the flesh and to be a captive and slave to sin. After giving my life to Christ, I truly believed in my heart that I had been set free and that I was forgiven, but my mind wasn’t on the same page as my heart. No, my mind was still a prisoner to what it once knew, and it would take a daily conscious effort to align my mind and heart to God’s Word so that I could fully live out the gift of freedom that I had been given. </p><p>There was one scripture that stuck with me from the very beginning of my journey, and I saw with my own eyes the warning of this verse come alive in the lives of those who would turn back to their old ways after being saved. 2 Peter 2:20, was the verse of awakening for me and I took heed to this warning, and I never went back. Day in and day out, I asked God to not only work in my heart, but also to work in my mind. I developed the habit of living out the Word in my daily life and putting it to practice so that my brain would develop a new way of thinking, and my new thoughts then became new actions. And then the day came, I finally experienced freedom from the mindset of captivity, my heart and my mind were working together in harmony and not separated from one another.</p><p>What I came to understand was that it was just as important for the heart to experience transformation as it was for the mind, and I understood by the warning of this scripture that one can certainly exist without the other; and when they exist separate from each other, we are only partially free. Jesus came so that we could live a life of complete freedom, mind, body and soul! It had become clear to me that I had a choice to make (as we all do), that I was either captive to my thoughts, or that I was going to take my thoughts captive; one of these always leads us back and the other always leads us forward in the fullness and freedom to which we were called to live. </p><p><strong><em>“Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your transformational power! Lord, I ask that You would break down the prison walls in the minds of those that are still in captivity and that they would begin to experience the fullness of freedom in Christ Jesus. Amen!” </em></strong></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1611250804929-3596APIDJKJZ9X1IY2MU/1%3A21%3A21+BlogPost.PNG,356
357,Faith Over Fear,post,2021-02-05 00:07:46,,/blogfeed/2021/1/25/fear-not-during-covid,,"<p>As I was taking a walk, I stopped to chat with a neighbor, and we mentioned that we missed visiting with each other. She suggested we could sit on my porch at a distance, but since I feel the cold easily, that doesn’t work for me in the winter. I offered to invite her into my house, but she quickly responded with a fearful, “No, I don’t go into anybody’s house right now. We haven’t seen our children and grandchildren in a long time.” I completely understand her fear - this disease can be deadly.  </p><p>So we turn to God and what He says. We try to live our lives trusting Him especially in the hard situations in our lives. He says repeatedly “<em>Do not fear, be anxious for nothing</em>.” We want to live our lives obeying what He says and trusting Him rather than living in fear. </p><p>There needs to be a balance between just trusting that we will not get the virus and, therefore, living without any caution (going anyplace we want, being with many people) <em>or</em> going the opposite way and giving into fear that cripples us, leaving us terrified. </p><p>What does God say to us about fear and living with His wisdom?  </p><p><em>“So do not fear, for I am with you, do not be dismayed, for I am your God.  I will strengthen you and help you.  I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.” Isa. 41:10</em></p><p>We can depend on the absolute truth that God is with us and He will strengthen and help us.  There is no maybe about it. When fear assails, and it will, we can put our faith in this truth. Take time to affirm this truth to yourself – God is with me so I don’t need to let fear cripple me.</p><p><em>“Be anxious for nothing, but in everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God and the peace of God which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” Phil. 4:6-7</em></p><p>Anxiety and fear will come given the current environment in which we live. But when it comes, this verse tells us what to do. Bring our fear to God in prayer with thanksgiving that He is in control in every situation, including COVID, and then experience His peace to guard our hearts and minds.</p><p>So as you stop letting fear guide your life, there is still the question of how to live in a world with COVID. Pastor Gabe has been preaching much about God’s wisdom as we study Proverbs. Rather than fear guiding us, we want God’s wisdom to guide us.  James 1:5-6 tells us to ask God in faith without doubting for wisdom and it will be given. When you are not sure what to do, where to go, and where not to go, what people you can see, seek God for His wisdom. He promises to guide us. He will guide through His Word, His Spirit and counsel of others.</p><p><strong><em>“Heavenly Father, I am thankful that You are sovereign and You have not given me a spirit of fear but power, love and a sound mind. I confess that sometimes I have let fear guide me during this time. Thank You Lord for forgiving me because of Jesus’ death for me. I put my trust in You and seek to hear Your wisdom through Your Word, Your Spirit and counsel of others. Use my life during this time to reveal You to others.”</em></strong></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1612483645198-MO0OE8294DFN67YLNEZR/IMG_9895.PNG,358
359,Steady,post,2021-01-07 21:38:40,,/blogfeed/2021/1/4/steady,,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading: </strong>“My heart is steadfast, O God; I will sing, I will sing praises, even with my soul.” (Psalm 108:1) </p><p>During one of my grad school moves, I distinctly remember struggling to carry out my mattress. The problem was not that it was too heavy. No, this poor little guy was flimsy as could be. So much so, you could barely lift it. And the accompanying bed was not much better - I don’t know where it came from, but I am pretty sure it was free. The wooden slats that held up the box springs tended to fall out during the night. One thing was made clear; it was time for a new bed! And not surprisingly, once I made that exchange, both my sleep and my back improved. </p><p>Sometimes our spiritual lives are a lot like that sad mattress. They may look good on the surface (as my bed did when covered with a bedspread and pillows), but “flimsy” is a more accurate description when we take a closer look. </p><p>When things get tough, our natural tendency is to give up, run away, hide, pretend, or point fingers. But God has something better in mind. Through His power, we can be strong, secure, steady, and stable.</p><p>Recently, I have been challenged by Ephesians 6:13, “Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm.” This section of scripture repeatedly urges us to stand firm. In other words, it is not automatic. We have to work at it.</p><p>Our spiritual strength is linked directly to the armor of God. Do you know what the first piece of armor listed here is? The belt of truth. We don’t grow strong by ignoring our shortcomings, but rather by facing them head-on. Standing firm always begins with truth.</p><p>For me, this involves identifying unhealthy thinking patterns and replacing them with God’s Word. Recently, I took the time to address some of my weaknesses in the form of a declaration. Here are a few examples:</p><ul data-rte-list=""default""><li><p>I am content and satisfied. (Psalm 131)</p></li><li><p>I am chosen to display the character of God. (Colossians 3:12)</p></li><li><p>My prayers are powerful. (James 5:16)</p></li><li><p>I have a ministry. And it matters. (Colossians 4:17)</p></li><li><p>I am steady. I don’t give up, and I don’t quit. (Ephesians 6:10)</p></li></ul><p>The start of a new year is the perfect time to “pull back the covers,” so to speak, and examine our hearts and minds. Take a few minutes to reflect on the following: </p><ul data-rte-list=""default""><li><p>What is it that causes you to grow “flimsy”?</p></li><li><p>What unhealthy thinking do you need to replace with a declaration of truth?</p></li><li><p>What does God have to say about your shortcomings and weaknesses?</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>“God, my heart is steady because You are steady. I choose to stand firm – not giving up, not running away, and not giving in. You are powerful, strong, and trustworthy. You never leave me, and You never forsake me. I can trust in you, even when life is insecure. I can find peace in chaos, strength in the storms, and joy in the trials. Amen.”</em></strong></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1609946547906-M9UGN6S7CXXH6OSR00AA/1%3A6%3A21+BlogPost.PNG,360
361,Real and Raw,post,2021-12-01 17:47:44,,/blogfeed/2021/12/1/real-and-raw,<p>This blog was written by Caleb Taylor.</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading: </strong>“The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? Though an army encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war arise against me, yet I will be confident.” (Psalm 27:1,3 ESV) </p><p>“Hey, how are you?” my friend asks me. “Doing well,” I reply. “Hey! Doing alright today?” my co-worker asks. “Yep, doing just fine,” I reply. “Everything going well, Caleb?” my boss inquires. “Yes, all is well,” I reply. </p><p>I don’t know about you, but sometimes I get really tired of talking about how I’m doing.  And honestly, sometimes I wish people would just stop asking me — because if they wouldn’t ask, I wouldn’t have to <em>lie </em>about how I’ve been. </p><p>The last year and a half of my life has hosted some of the most difficult things I’ve ever had to walk through. From serious health issues in my immediate family to difficult situations in the workplace, I’ve run the gamut of emotions from anxiety to burnout in the last 18 months. And yet, every time someone asks how I’m doing, I shift into autopilot and say exactly what I believe they want to hear: “<em>I’m doing well</em>.” </p><p>If you’re anything like me, you do this too. You can be at your absolute breaking point — yet, for fear of being looked at differently or admitting weakness, you withhold and give the answer that's the easiest to swallow. And, odds are, if you and I are doing this with our friends and our coworkers, we're also doing it with God. Rather than approaching God in pure honesty, we guard our prayers and give God the easy ""I'm doing well"" spiel. But this isn't what God desires; He wants our unfiltered honesty and raw emotion, and He wants to remind us of His faithfulness in the midst of it. </p><p>David models this honesty for us in Psalm 27. The positivity that David displays isn't fake or overdone, and it's surely not an ""I'm doing well"" kind of response: it's grounded in the truth of God's faithfulness. David openly acknowledges that his situation is difficult — impossible, even — but he remains confident in his stronghold and his light in even the darkest of situations: the Lord. David points at his circumstances and recognizes them for what they are: brutal, unfair, and downright difficult. He is adamant about processing <em>with </em>His God, and it is in this processing that David regains his confidence in the One who is his unwavering hope — his light in the darkness. </p><p>If you and I can learn to employ honesty with God like David's — if we can learn to process <em>with </em>God rather than <em>hide </em>it from Him — we will come to the conclusion that even when our situation is dark, even when we don’t know what to do, even when we don’t see God or feel Him at times, He is right there by our side, casting healing light into our darkness. </p><p>Take a moment to be absolutely honest and straightforward with God about the difficulty you're currently facing. Lay it all out before Him in the way that is uniquely you.  Process with Him, confess to Him, wrestle with Him — leave nothing unsaid or understated. God desires your honesty.  </p><p><strong><em>Father, you know me better than I even know myself. You know my deficiencies. You know my fears. You know my hang-ups. You know what I’m going through right now,  and You know how much I’m struggling with it. So, in this moment, I want to be entirely honest with You. I refuse to drift into autopilot and withhold any part of me from You. I trust that You have my back, that You care for me, and that You truly are good. Remind me of Your love as I process with You in this season. Thank you for Your presence and Your Holy Spirit that guides me in this process. In Jesus’ name</em></strong><br/></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1638380559356-0XRYF56H0CYDS0H0IXO9/real+and+raw+final.jpg,362
363,The Reason We Burn,post,2021-12-15 18:41:24,,/blogfeed/2021/12/15/the-reason-we-burn,<p>This blog was written by Kristin Fields.</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading:</strong> “You are the light of the world.” (Matthew 5:14 NIV)                                                                         “He will not crush the weakest reed or put out a flickering candle.” (Isaiah 42:3 NLT) </p><p>“Father God, if I’m <em>the light of the world</em>, then I must be failing You.” Do you ever find yourself thinking or praying something like that? It can be hard to believe Jesus’ declaration when you feel more like a smoking match. The truth is, regardless of how you feel, His plan for you has not changed. You are actually positioned to be stoked by His Spirit. </p><p>Keep in mind the Lord is not disappointed when you feel burned out. He knows we can grow weary, discouraged, and disheartened. Life spins us through cycles of wins and losses, joy and grief, and every day can hold innumerable highs and lows. He has lived here just like us and His soul was put to the test as well. Perhaps this is one reason why He tells us, <em>“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."" </em>(Matthew 11:28 NIV) He understands. </p><p>The prophet Isaiah gave us this image: “<em>He will not... put out a flickering candle.” </em>(<em>Isaiah 42:3) </em>The Lord sees you flickering away and feels compassion for you. It reminds me of the burning candles we may hold during  a candlelight service (or the smoke-free alternative… glow sticks). You protect that little flame by surrounding it with your cupped hand. That is how the Lord carries you, close to Himself and covered. That’s grace. You are accepted as you are even when you are barely smoldering. He tends to you until your soul is energized by His love, burning for others to see Him. </p><p>Relief comes when you open yourself to the Lord’s constant love. His love becomes your fuel. Pause from the noise of your day to consider how He has rescued you. Remember His faithfulness in past trials. Notice the beauty of His creation surrounding you and the things you enjoy that He’s given to you. Let His Word roll around in your mind. When you consider Him, who is light and love, the Holy Spirit ignites within you. You are a carrier of His light and love in the world. </p><p><strong><em>Father God, thank You that Your Word says those who look to You for help will be radiant with joy. I look to You. Please ignite my love and help me to burn brightly for You today. It is in Jesus Christ’s name that I pray, amen.</em></strong></p><p><br/><br/></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1639593609308-DMAQ39VGOKRI2E2XA3VQ/Untitled-1.jpg,364

For years I gave up making formal resolutions because adhering to them was so tough. It was discouraging to set a goal and miss the mark time and time again. “Maybe I’m not setting the right goals,” I eventually concluded. “Maybe there’s a better way to help my growth and development. What does God think about all of this?” I wondered.</p><p>We’re far enough into 2021 to see it will require a lot of flexibility to function well. Amidst a different set of challenging circumstances, the prophet Isaiah realized something special about God’s people. He noted that are we being *made* by God’s hand. We are clay, not a finished project yet, still in the development phase. </p><p>When a work of pottery is being created, it is the maker who chooses how to shape the object. The potter decides what to make the clay into and what traits it will have. Our development process is the same. God, our Potter, is molding us into something new. He picks our features and purposes. He shapes us into what He wills us to be.  </p><p>In a world of Covid, personal, political, and economic crises, God shows us through his word he wants to mold our hearts and lives. He desires to shape us into His pre-planned pottery! God has goals for YOU in 2021. </p><p>As you consider setting resolutions for this year or lament the ones you have already made and broken, what would it look like to embrace what God is teaching you in this season rather than make plans exclusively based off human objectives?</p><p>Ask God specifically what traits He wants to birth in you in this season. What are His goals for your heart? Recently, He showed me that He wants me to become more mature by learning patience. And thank God, He has given me an abundance of opportunities to embrace it and practice patience in this crazy world! What is God molding you to be? Rather than fighting against the process, how can you welcome the Lord’s goals for you and embrace the ways He shapes you? You will find incredible purpose and success this year if you seek the Lord’s objectives for you, because God never fails at His goals. </p><p><strong><em>“Father, You are the Potter and I am the clay. I surrender to You. Soften my heart and show me how You want me to grow in this season. I want to embrace Your work in me, not fight against it.” </em></strong></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1613586555644-4MLCN1RG7X2ZIA6GSM9O/2%3A17%3A21+Blog+Post.PNG,366
367,Finding Family,post,2021-03-03 19:45:56,,/blogfeed/2021/2/17/finding-family,,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading</strong>: “Let all that you do be done with love.” 1 Corinthians 16:14</p><p>On November 15, 2020 I was baptized at The Point, and this is part of my testimony that was written on that day.</p><p>Church has always been a part of my life, and I’ve spent 50 years attending church, serving, teaching, and volunteering. However, I recently began feeling that God was leading me to make a change. My church family and activities were things that I had always enjoyed, but now I seemed to be on a quest for something deeper and truer to the real message of Jesus. I considered making that change and searching for more. </p><p>So I began praying for direction and set out on my journey. Part of my plan was to visit a few local churches. A friend told me about the Point, and the first Sunday I attended just happened to be a celebration of the Point’s 10th anniversary! There were balloons, kettle corn, and other fun surprises, but what stood out most to me were the love I experienced, prayer, and a strong sense of family. I loved that visit and felt a connection from the first welcoming handshake.  The next Sunday I returned, and even without all the extra celebrations, the love, prayer and sense of family were still there, and were just as energizing and illuminating as before.</p><p>Soon I signed up for Growth Track, which has been very helpful to me in discovering my personal strengths and “purposeful design.” I’ve found several opportunities for serving and enjoy it very much. I’m also excited about the small groups I’ve attended and cannot speak highly enough about them and the way they continue to promote a strong sense of family. I highly recommend both of these programs to any new believers or members.</p><p>Yes, I felt at home that very first day. And now in our new church facility, the message on the wall reminds me of an amazing concept: “Love God, Love People, Love Life.” In fact, I have been focusing on LOVE, and find that it is a superpower! Jesus is my guide and example. I’ve also been reading God’s Word, journaling and praying the scriptures.</p><p>During this process I’ve read a book by Bob Goff- Love Does. The author wrote one line that really stands out to me – “Love is a DO thing.  It’s an energy that has to be dissipated.” This is what The Point is living and what I am aiming to do as well. “We love each other because He loved us first.” (1 John 4:19)  Indeed, God is love, and He graciously puts us in church families where we can receive and share that love with others.</p><p><strong><em>“Thank you, Lord, for your great love for us, and for leading us to walk with you each day. As we follow you on our life’s journey, please guide us into all truth and use us for your kingdom. We love you and give you glory and praise. In Jesus’ name, Amen.”</em></strong></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1614800652347-SXNWIUICKO8AJZJN6BN8/3%3A3%3A21+Blog.jpg,368
369,"That Was Then, This Is Now",post,2021-03-17 13:25:32,,/blogfeed/2021/3/17/nd4nf97e4x2end654z36gsqh69zeco,,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading:</strong><em> </em>“And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” Matthew 28:20</p><p>I haven’t traveled extensively, but have stepped foot in Washington, D.C. and Washington state; Toronto and Tijuana; Burlington, Wisconsin and Bermuda and several places in between. All have been memorable, but none so memorable as my trip to Israel. In my planning, I anticipated “walking where Jesus walked” and experiencing the Holy Land first-hand. Nothing - not even Pastor Gabe’s telling us how life-altering it would be - prepared me for what happened there.</p><p>I’m an “outline,” step-by-step, measure-twice-cut-once kind of person. This first, this next, then this - you get the picture. Why was I so surprised that the itinerary didn’t start in Bethlehem and end at Calvary? I mean, if I were to walk in His steps, wouldn’t we go where He went, the way He went, in the order He went? I am so glad we didn’t, as it enabled me to concentrate on where I was, rather than ponder the next location. So I focused on each step, which, by the way, is good advice when walking the sandal-polished stones of Jerusalem’s ancient streets! </p><p>With each step where Jesus’s feet touched, “Jesus was HERE!” filled my thoughts…the small portion of stairway leading to the temple, still visible since He first walked those stones;  the tortuous path to Golgotha, including one spot His blood and sweat most assuredly dripped onto the pavement; the Sea of Galilee’s sandy shore; the short path between Peter’s house and the nearby synagogue; the actual stairs He climbed to Caiaphas’s house; and the Garden of Gethsemane. </p><p>It happened in the Garden. Beautiful. Quiet. Peaceful. Yet, in the stillness, was an awareness of Jesus’s agony as He cried out to the Father, beseeched his companions to watch with Him, sweat great drops of blood, and surrendered to the perfect will of God. Imagining how it was, I prayed step-by-step through that Garden, telling myself again, “Jesus was HERE!” Suddenly, overwhelmingly, I sensed His presence, and heard Him speak to my heart, “I am here with you NOW!” There. There it was. As awesome, as inspiring, as emotional as it was to have planted my feet where He had planted His, it was there, in that Garden, that He reminded me in no uncertain terms that He is with us in the NOW. He agonized in the Garden there and then so He could be with us here and now. In every moment, every day, every triumph, every trial, He IS with us… in the exciting and the mundane; in the stress and the calm; in the joy and the grief...not WAS, but IS…<em> Is. With. Us. </em>He lives in the perpetual NOW! I will always treasure having followed His footsteps there and then, but more precious is knowing He’s walking with us here and now. Is your walk difficult? He’s walking with you. Are you plodding through grief? He’s beside you. Are you dancing with joy? He’s dancing with you. In every circumstance, we can embrace Him, His peace, His joy. Here. Now. Forever!</p><p><strong><em>“Lord, thank you that because of your immense love and perfect sacrifice, your everlasting presence is with us in every circumstance and situation. May we always be aware of that presence, knowing you are with us always, for you have said in your Word, “Never will I leave you, nor forsake you” (Hebrews 13:5).  Remind us that you are walking with us every step of the way...when we rejoice, when we grieve, in special celebrations or in everyday routines. Let us long to know you more and more on our daily walk with you, as we study your Word, listen for your voice, and submit to your will. Amen.”</em></strong></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1616000728016-CO4TI4QYNSYRCKR7PXUX/3%3A17%3A21+Blog.PNG,370
371,"A Love Story…Love for Family, Love for God",post,2021-04-09 15:41:07,,/blogfeed/2021/3/31/a-love-storylove-for-family-love-for-god,,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading: </strong>“This is the day that the Lord has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.”  (Psalms. 118:24)</p><p>This is one of my favorite verses. I start my morning prayer with this verse every day. It’s a verse that I relate to and a reminder that God is the one in control but it’s up to me to choose whether I’m grateful and/or joyful or whether I respond in a different way. This is a comfortable verse for me because I am grateful for each day and life is generally pretty good. It’s easy to be grateful and joyful when life is pretty good. However, I recognize that other people have circumstances in their lives that make this verse more challenging in terms of “rejoicing and being glad in it”. Trials present themselves and life starts to feel less gratifying and less joyful.  How do we respond?</p><p>Last year I wrote a blog about a friend, “G”, who had suffered a life-threatening injury and how inspired I was by the way her family responded to this tragedy. I knew this was a strong family of faith but was completely in awe of how they were handling the situation. “T”, her husband, from the day of her injury had emphasized to his girls that each day was a gift, and they would praise God for any time they had, or any progress made. At the time no one knew what her future would look like. That is still true a year later. Because of the severity of her injury her health care has been extremely challenging including intensive care and long-term rehabilitation. To make the situation more difficult the world saw the emergence of Covid 19 which changed everything, including the approach and availability of medical care and rehabilitation. Because of Covid no one from her family could be with her in the medical rehab facility so they decided to take her home and provide 24-hour care. Their support team, which had included medical professionals and dozens of friends and family, was reduced down to her husband, her sister, and a mother/daughter care team. They, as a family, were, and continue to be, exhausted but have never given up hope. For most of us it would be difficult to continue to thank the Lord and be grateful or joyful for these circumstances. The family posts a daily blog to keep all of us informed on her progress. Every single post, while sometimes uplifting, sometimes depressing, never fails to give thanks to the Lord and show gratitude for the gift of that day. </p><p>From the outside looking in this has been a painful journey to watch. However, it is also a story of amazing love of family members and love between this family and God. Painful to have so many unknowns and yet beautiful in that they have never blamed God or lost faith. I’m sure they have questions and ask “why” but that has never been their focus. The family refers to her journey as a marathon, not a sprint. They ask for prayers for their endurance and her healing. They are joyful with each small victory in her recovery and consider it their ministry to provide love and care. I think of James 1:2-3, “Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of any kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance”.    </p><p>The family’s daily post, written by her husband, recently stated,“G” and I have talked about thanking him (God) for whatever comes our way. If we had his perspective, we could see why this is happening and the good that will come from it. I remind “G”, God must be really doing some good through our present trial. She seems to trust that encouragement and have hope in his promises.”</p><p>In my life I have had seasons of highs and lows but nothing to this degree. This family inspires me every day to strive to have their complete trust in our Lord! They have shown me how to take each day and appreciate the gifts it brings. To me they embody Psalm 11:24 and how important it is, even when life isn’t that easy.</p><p><strong><em>“Heavenly Father, thank you for the example of this beautiful family. We are so grateful that you never leave us to go through trials alone. Please help us continue to learn from you and to bring honor through our perseverance. In your precious name we pray. Amen.”</em></strong></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1617632979137-435LK1DZ397IEVX82814/LoveStoryBlog.jpg,372
373,Speak Out,post,2021-04-21 18:54:31,,/blogfeed/2021/4/21/speak-out,,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading:  </strong>“. . . as [Peter and John] were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them, greatly annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. And they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening. But many of those who had heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to about five thousand.” Acts 4:1-4</p><p>These days your words can get you in trouble. Saying the wrong thing can get you a reprimand in some quarters or even cost you your job. Words matter. </p><p>That’s no less true for Christians living out their faith in obedience to the Lord Jesus Christ. We live in a day when Isaiah’s words of warning couldn’t be more true:</p><p>“Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; Who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness; Who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!” Isaiah 5:20</p><p>Today loud voices say you’re evil, dark, bitter if you’re a Christian. We can add hateful to Isaiah’s list.  In times like these, dare we identify ourselves as Christians? Dare we reach out to others with the Good News about Jesus Christ? There could be a price to pay, as Peter and John experienced in their day.</p><p>It’s tempting to avoid trouble by hiding our faith, blending in, or fleeing the situation before we can be found out. But that creates a dilemma, because Jesus said, “whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes . . . .” (Luke 9:26). Who wants that?</p><p>The other option is to believe, be bold, and speak out—in love. That seems insanely counterintuitive, but remember: We’re in a battle, not with people, but with dark forces in the spiritual realm. Paul told the Ephesians, “we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, . . . authorities, . . . cosmic powers over this present darkness, . . . spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places” (Ephesians 6:12). When we love people, even the ones who despise us and find us annoying, we’re doing what Jesus bid us to do (Matthew 5:44), and we’re following His example. Haters can become believers. Enemies can become friends. Remember Saul who became Paul? And we can be sure that the Holy Spirit is working in people’s hearts, just like He did in ours by convicting us of sin and leading us to faith in Jesus Christ. And He’s still using believers to reach nonbelievers. </p><p>It can be scary. Even the Apostle Paul needed prayer for words and boldness, asking the Ephesian church to pray “that words may be given to me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel, 20 for which I am an ambassador in chains, that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak” (Ephesians 6:19-20). And what about Peter and John, whose words got them in trouble? Two things: (1) Some 5,000 became believers (Acts 4:4); (2) they reported everything to their friends, prayed together, were filled with the Holy Spirit, and continued to speak out with boldness (Acts 4:23-24, 31).</p><p><strong>“<em>Dear Father, empower us as believers in Jesus Christ to be light bearers in a dark world getting darker; channels of love in all its expressions in a time of division, distrust, and hate; victors in life, no matter what present battles we’re facing; and clear, calm voices boldly speaking the truth in love. Thank You for Your Spirit, working in us and through us, working in the hearts of those around us, some of whom will believe, if we speak out. Amen.”</em></strong></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1619031260955-U8DJVAV99Z97OXW11JM1/SpeakOut2.jpg,374
375,God is at Work in Hard Seasons,post,2021-05-05 20:47:32,,/blogfeed/2021/4/28/god-is-at-work-in-hard-seasons,,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading: </strong>“I lift up my eyes to the hills. From where does my help come? My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.” Psalm 121:1-2 ESV</p><p>The other day I was texting with a fellow new mom friend about how chaotic and busy the season of new motherhood felt. We chatted about our shared season of having little ones, a season where you often don’t have a second to check-in on yourself and self-care takes the form of a 5-minute shower twice a week. We echoed each other’s sentiment of being in survival mode. And then these words were laid on my heart: “God is at work in my hard seasons.” </p><p>I have seen the mantra “I can do hard things” proclaimed a lot, especially in the past year. There are many days where I rephrase this mantra into “I have no choice but to do hard things”, but that isn’t the whole truth. The truth of the matter is that I can do hard things through Christ as my strength. As I look back on my life and analyze places of the greatest growth in my faith, they are tied to seasons of trial: seasons where I questioned who I was, what my purpose was, and if God really had a plan for my circumstances. I couldn’t see God at work, but I have learned to feel him at work in those seasons. Even when it seems like I am just in survival mode, there are things He is doing to mold, shape and refine me for the work ahead, as hard and painful as that might feel. If you too are experiencing a tough season, I want to encourage you with these three actions. </p><p><strong>Look up</strong>. Take a second at least once a day to lift up your eyes. Remove your gaze from your circumstances and look up to the God of all comfort, strength, peace and grace, who loves you more than you can even begin to fathom. </p><p><strong>Fill your cup</strong>. God has put people, positions, passions, and more in your life that require your time and attention. Most of these require much of you every single day. Remember the importance of filling your own cup first, so that you have something to give. This may look different for you than it does for me, but discovering what it is that fills your cup, can be one of the greatest gifts you can give to those around you. </p><p><strong>Flower where you’re planted</strong>. I’m not sure about you, but I have killed many plants from overwatering them. Many plants need dry, parched conditions to thrive. You might find yourself in such conditions right now, and I encourage you to flower right where you are. Dry seasons are not without moments of joy and triumph. Your dry season, and the flowering you do in your dry season, will speak of God’s glory more than any #the-struggle-is-real Instagram post. Your flowers will speak to others in ways that only God can orchestrate and you might be just the encouragement someone needs to look for the blessings in their season. </p><p><strong><em>“Gracious God, I ask that you draw us near to you. May we look to you for our help and strength, no matter our circumstances. May we seek to glorify you in all that we say and do, and we commit all our seasons to your ultimate glory. Amen.”</em></strong></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1620247570471-E36EJMOZM4B7X5OPCREN/GodIsAtWork.jpg,376
377,Beauty in the Storm,post,2021-06-02 14:44:54,,/blogfeed/2021/5/11/beauty-in-the-storm,<p>This blog was written by Amanda Eheart.</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading:  </strong>He has made everything beautiful in its time. Ecclesiastes 3:11</p><p>One of my favorite things to do is watch the sunset. Sunrises are great too because it feels like a gentle wake up from God. It’s like He is saying “Good morning, welcome to this new day I created for you.” A sunset, though, is such a bold and beautiful reminder that He has guided us through another day with Him. It’s one more gift from Him before my day is over. </p><p>Sunsets are beautiful but they are not created equal. Have you ever seen a sunset after a storm? They have some of the most stunning colors I have ever seen. I love a good storm too!  Sitting in the living room listening to the rain and thunder while watching the lightning can be relaxing. I know I am weird in saying this but...I even like it when the power goes out. With no power you have no choice but to sit and pay attention to what is going on around you. I love it! A storm can be cool and scary at the same time. Especially when you are in it. There can be a lot of power behind it. And with that power comes the uncertainty of what could happen. </p><p>This is why we use storms to describe life. There are times when beautiful weather is predicted but a storm comes out of nowhere and causes major destruction. It’s the same with life. Life can be all good and then a storm comes out of nowhere. A friend moves, a job is lost, a child is sick, a spouse leaves, a parent dies, or countless other things that make us feel like our life is falling apart. Life can change in the blink of an eye just like the weather.</p><p>You want to know the best part of a storm and life? There is usually someone there during and after the storm that wants to help and make things better. Look for them and let them help. As silly as it sounds...let them be your sunset. Let them add beauty to your storm. You won’t regret it!</p><p>Over the past year I have been reminded of just how much beauty I actually have in my life. Last year was tough! There was lots of pain and tears. There was also a lot of love and hope. I lost 3 very important people in my life and my friends and family surrounded me with that love and hope even in the middle of a pandemic. They covered me in prayer and helped me find some joy. They helped me to see the sunset after my storm. I will forever be thankful to them for that. I pray you have someone in your life to add beauty to it.</p><p><strong><em>“God, Help us to see the beauty you place in our lives. We know it may not always be as obvious as the bold and beautiful colors that are in the sky after a storm. Help us to see it in the smile of a stranger. A kind word from an acquaintance. A hug from a friend or family member. You know we are going to go through hard times but you also know who will be there in those moments when we need them. Help us to see them and let them help! Better yet help us notice opportunities to be the beauty in someone else’s life! Amen!”</em></strong></p><p> </p><p> </p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1622645070531-BCTHCU9JAPO0D54U13MI/beauty+in+the+storm.png,378
379,Think About Such Things,post,2021-06-23 13:00:00,,/blogfeed/2021/6/21/think-about-such-things,<p>This blog was written by Debbie Fletcher.</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading</strong>:  <em>Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable – if anything is excellent or praiseworthy – think about such things.”  </em>Philippians 4:8</p><p>Have you ever found yourself in a place where your thoughts were just reeling around, and you can’t make them stop?   Or maybe you notice the enemy has planted himself right in your mind. Maybe you’ve experienced a season of hurt, and the pain just won’t subside.  Or maybe a fleeting thought gave way to a decision that might have lifelong repercussions.  It may seem this season we have been in might intensify some of these situations.</p><p>I think we can all agree living in this pandemic has changed each of us in some way.  Some ways we can see as beneficial and change for the better, and some we may see as “Yikes – was that really me who did, said, thought that”?   Through these times, what I have learned more and more is that we must choose each day to trust God.  I want to talk a moment about this verse from Philippians. This is a verse I read to my children a lot at the dinner table during their high school years, and it is one of my life verses.  </p><p>I love this verse because it tells us what we are to think about.  When we control what our mind thinks, we can then have better control over our actions.   This verse does not suggest when we are in the mood to think about these things, or when everything is going right to think about such things, it says “think about such things”.  It is a direct command.  As I even take each word and think about what each one means, it gives us a deeper understanding of how God wants our minds to be filled.  I just want to take a couple minutes and go a little deeper with each word.</p><p>TRUE – real, genuine, sincere, integrity of character, or accurate.  It is the opposite of dishonest and unreliable.</p><p>NOBLE – possessing outstanding qualities, grand or impressive.  Dignified and worth respect.</p><p>RIGHT –just, good, proper, facts or truth, appropriate, conformity to God’s standards.</p><p>PURE – not contaminated, sincere, not mixed with anything, spotless, moral or wholesome.</p><p>LOVELY – pleasing and agreeable, delightful, beauty, harmony, grace.  (only place in NT mentioned)</p><p>ADMIRABLE – deserving the highest esteem, positive and constructive.

383,She Sat By Him,post,2021-07-21 14:09:57,,/blogfeed/2021/7/21/she-sat-by-him,<p>This blog was written by Kristin Fields.</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading:</strong><em> “Surely You love the people; all the holy ones are in Your hand, and they sit down at Your feet; each receives Your words--”</em> (Deut. 33:3)</p><p><em>“She had a sister named Mary, who also sat at the Lord’s feet and was listening to what he said. ‘…but one thing is necessary. Mary has made the right choice, and it will not be taken away from her.’” </em>(Luke 10:39, 42)</p><p><em>“I do not call you servants any longer, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you [My] friends, because I have revealed to you everything that I have heard from My Father.”</em> (John 15:15 AMP)</p><p>“How do <em>you</em> spend time with Jesus, Dad?” </p><p>“Hmm, mainly prayer, I suppose. How about you?”</p><p>“The same, but sometimes I just imagine we’re throwing the baseball around.”</p><p>There is no sweeter insight into our son’s spiritual life for me. The Holy Spirit has revealed Jesus to my boy as his companion and champion. He’s worshipping Jesus by spending time with him in his mind, by practicing his presence in a way that is adoring to our Savior. Our son feels welcomed into a relationship with Jesus, rather than feeling he must do something to be in his presence.</p><p>We see this act of drawing near to Jesus in reverent friendship throughout scripture, but I am particularly drawn to the love between Mary, Martha, Lazarus, and Jesus. They were friends Jesus loved. John 11:5 (NIV) tells us, <em>“Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.”</em> These siblings lived together in Bethany near Jerusalem where Jesus would visit in their home. They were like family to him.</p><p>I especially enjoy how Mary enjoyed Jesus’ company. In Luke 10:40, we see that Mary left her sister and their hostess duties to jump at the chance to listen to Jesus teach while he was visiting. <em>“She had a sister named Mary, who seated herself at the Lord’s feet and was continually listening to His teaching”</em> (Luke 10:39 AMP). Mary clung to Jesus’ every word and felt welcomed by this family-friend to leave her responsibilities and enjoy his company, at ease, listening and learning like the other disciples - an unusual circumstance for an ancient Middle Eastern woman. Can you imagine her sense of awe as Jesus unveiled His Father’s love through scripture and the peaceful authority that emanated from him? The joy that must have filled Mary’s heart as he assured her frustrated sister,<em> “There is only one thing worth being concerned about. Mary has discovered it, and it will not be taken away from her” </em>(Luke 10:42 NLT).</p><p>It’s not coincidental that in the very next paragraph we learn from Jesus how to pray. He teaches us to draw near in prayer as his friend, as a child boldly asking for what we need. Notice these illustrations are mentioned after the adoring example of Mary who did not <em>work</em> to get into the presence of Jesus. She sat by him as a beloved friend. </p><p>I want to encourage you to leave your responsibility for a minute and forget the expectations of others. In a posture of prayer sit yourself close to your most precious friend Jesus and enjoy his company. Imagine the love in his eyes as he welcomes you. Listen to what he may say to you. Spend time adoring Jesus and be loved by him. Like my son, the Holy Spirit may reveal Jesus to you in a very special way! This good thing will never be taken away from you because you are Jesus’ very own treasured friend and family.</p><p><strong><em>Heavenly Father, thank You for what your Word reveals about your desire for me. Please help me to be like Mary and come to You knowing that I am always eagerly welcomed. I ask for the gift of knowing Lord Jesus as my closest friend. In Jesus’ name, I pray. Amen.</em></strong></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1626876489709-7XKEHXRJID3DY7XMMRT5/She+Sat+by+Him.jpg,384
385,Pray Without Ceasing,post,2021-07-07 21:00:00,,/blogfeed/2021/7/7/pray-without-ceasing,<p>This blog was written by Melody Criswell.</p><p></p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading</strong>:  “<em>Now He was telling them a parable to show that at all times they ought to pray and not to lose heart.”  </em>Luke 18:1</p><p>Have you ever “lost heart” in praying?  Perhaps you didn’t receive the answer you desired, or maybe just didn’t know <em>how</em> to pray or what to say to God in a particular situation, or you may have felt too emotional or sad to even find the energy to pray.  Our church family has recently experienced a terrible tragedy in the loss of one of our dear young people, and it has been deeply felt by so many of us.  But there is encouragement and truth to be found in God’s Word, and I’d like to share some of that encouragement with you.  </p><p>No sincere, heartfelt prayer from a Christian is ever wasted.  No matter what the outcome — something as precious to God as a prayer is never ever wasted.  It is impossible in God’s economy.  “My times are in Thy hands (Psalm 31:15a)”… God “knows the end from the beginning” (Isaiah 46:10), and He told us to PRAY.  Psalm 139 says that God knows every day of our life, before we have lived one of them.  We have NO IDEA how our prayers are used; not the fullness of it anyway.   If God saw our prayers as “wasted”, He wouldn’t prompt us — individually and collectively — to pray so much.</p><p>The truth is that our prayers are a sweet aroma before God (Revelation 5:8), and when we pray, we are being <em>obedient</em>.  </p><p>“Now in the same way the Spirit also helps us in our weakness; for we do not know what to pray for as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.” (Romans 8:26).  I’ve experienced moments when I am absolutely overwhelmed with grief, and I cry out to God, and it feels like the Holy Spirit is actually grieving through me.  Just like Romans 8:26, the Holy Spirit can pray through people; and I think the Spirit can use anyone.</p><p>Have you ever awakened during the night with a strong impression to pray for someone?  I wonder if in those moments when we are overcome with anguish and tears — maybe God somehow lets us bear a small piece of their burden.  It’s almost like a little bit of their pain can roll over onto us, when we cry out on their behalf.  I believe that such prompting is from the Spirit of God; and we are standing in the gap for them, with groaning too deep for words… that we are lifting them up so that they can have grace and strength for the moment.</p><p>God honors our tears.  Travail is a particular kind of prayer. It is an intense type of intercession; so intense that the apostle Paul compared it to the pangs of childbirth (Galatians 4:19).  It’s very emotional, often tearful, and sometimes wordless. It can be quiet or loud; God hears it all. Those tears are a language that God understands well, and those TEARS are PRAYERS.  No tear is ever wasted, just as no prayer is ever wasted!  In Psalm 56:8 we read that God keeps our tears in His bottle; that’s how precious they are to God!</p><p>We are promised, however, in Revelation 21:4 that “He [God] will wipe every tear from their eyes”, and there will be no more mourning or crying or pain….”  It’s not just that we won’t cry anymore, it’s better than that.  God Himself will tenderly wipe our tears away – and somehow we will know that those are the last tears we will ever cry, for all of eternity!</p><p>We are told in 1 Thessalonians to “Rejoice always; pray without ceasing, and in everything give thanks; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.”  May it ever be so, in Jesus’ name!</p><p><strong><em>O Lord, grant us grace and courage to come to You always in prayer, knowing that You are a God of great mercy and love, and You always know what’s best. Help us to trust in Your wisdom and embrace Your perfect will for our lives and the lives of others.  In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></strong></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1625672344281-SXW300XH6RF1RIMPAD55/Pray+without+ceasing.jpg,386
387,In-Between,post,2022-01-28 14:45:00,,/blogfeed/2022/1/28/in-between,<p>This blog was written by Helen Lockwood.</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading:</strong> “And God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light.”  (Genesis 1:3 NIV)“There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light.” (Revelation 22:5 NIV)</p><p>From Genesis 1 to Revelation 22, there is light… and in-between, there is darkness.  Sin. Sickness. Death. Sin. Fear. Pain. Sin. Suffering. War. Sin. Depression. Heartache. More Sin.  </p><p>We live in that “In-Between,” in a darkened world affected by mankind’s sin and its ramifications. Some days, we don’t feel it so deeply, so harshly.  Moments of joy flicker like a candle, igniting hope. Other days, like lava, the darkness flows over our souls, destroying everything in its path, leaving only pain and gray ash. </p><p>I lay in the darkened hospital room, pregnant, with the very real possibility that my leg would be amputated below the knee, completely overwhelmed by the “In-Between.” Would my unborn baby survive? Would I? Fear. Pain. Heartache. The murky pall of helplessness shrouded me.  </p><p>Yet, just as volcanic ash leaves the ground more fertile, the ashes of suffering create a rich soul-soil for faith’s seeds. In that darkness, I slowly began to internalize the truths of Psalm 18:28, “You, LORD, keep my lamp burning; my God turns my darkness into light;” and of John 8:12, where Jesus declared, ‘I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.’”  In that darkness, I began to reach for that light as a seedling reaches toward the sun, germinating in its light. In that darkness, I began to reach toward the Son and grow in the Light of my Savior, my Jesus. </p><p>One day, miraculously, the Lord sparked a tiny insight - insight that I never could have guessed and even the doctor hadn’t perceived - insight that made all the difference - saving both my leg and my baby. As God blew on that spark, a faith flame ignited, bringing light and life. Only later would I realize just how brightly that Light had illuminated my situation, for it was through this experience that an underlying health condition was revealed; which, if undetected, would have killed me. Once again, God “Romans 8:28-ed” a dark and devastating situation, as He has for me over and again since then. </p><p>The Light of the World, Who is with God in Genesis and in Revelation, also permeates the “In-Between.”  We see Him in every book of the Bible, and, when we look, in every dark “In-Between” of our lives.  When the darkness is overwhelming, “He is the lamp to our feet and the light to our path” (Psalm 119:105) and when circumstances try to snuff out the light, “The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it” (John 1:5.)  In speaking of God’s faithfulness and the reliability of Scripture, C.H. Spurgeon declared, “In your darkest hour, you may have no candle but a single promise, and yet that lone light shall make high noon of your midnight.”  It is true. I have found it unfailingly to be so. May you find it so as well, as you seek Him in the “In-Between”.</p><p><strong><em>Lord, thank you for being our Light in the darkness of the “In-Between.”  May we bask in Your Light as we seek You in Scripture, in prayer, and in obedience to Your Word. Let the Light of Your Truth shine in us to a darkened world, that You might get all the glory and honor.  In Jesus’ holy, precious Name, Amen!</em></strong></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1643380467543-JATOO603ITCBC8KJWV32/In-Between.jpg,388

No matter how high I climbed, there was going to be emptiness at the top.”</p>","<div>
<h1><strong><br/>A Life Without Want</strong><br/></h1><h3><em>The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. Psalm 23:1</em></h3><p></p><p>Most of my business career, I was in the relentless pursuit of “want”.  Whether it was the want of money, status, or some milestone of success, my life was oriented toward achievement.  Every morning, I woke up and aligned my calendar with my wants. </p><p> At the end of the day, I would look back and ask, “Did I make progress, am I any closer to achieving what <em>I </em>want?”  Whether I checked everything off my list that day or not, I was still feeling dissatisfied– I didn’t have the time to do everything.  </p><p>In my mind, if I could reach the next level, I could be content, slow down, and enjoy the process.  However, as my career progressed and I started to achieve some of my wants, I was becoming less satisfied, less content. To offset the discontentment, I would speed up and push harder, climb faster.</p><p>Stephen Covey, author of the book 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, once wrote, </p><blockquote><p>“If the ladder is not leaning against the right wall, every step we take just gets us to the wrong place faster.” </p></blockquote><p>I eventually reached a point in my career where I realized my ladder was on the wrong wall. No matter how high I climbed, there was going to be emptiness at the top.  </p><p>While I had read all the books on success in pursuit of contentment, I had brushed over how Jesus defined a content life. Simply put, Jesus said to live a life characterized by contentment, we just need to love God, and love people.  </p><p></p><blockquote><p><em> “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment.</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’  - Matthew 22: 37-40 </em></p></blockquote><p></p><p>In reality, my wants were defined by the world’s definition of success. However, when I began to reorient toward Jesus’s definition of “success”, I realized my yearning for success was actually an innate desire from God to be in relationship with him. Or put another way, when my  wants began to align with His wants, peace began to reign in my life. Striving began to diminish. </p><p>In John 14:27, Jesus says,</p><blockquote><p>“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.”  </p></blockquote><p>I love that part, “my peace”. That is not a peace that you can buy or achieve. That’s a peace we receive, as believers in Christ, from <em>El Shaddai</em>— the all sufficient God— the God that is from eternity to eternity.   </p><p>As I think about climbing my ladder on the wrong wall, I think of Jesus being at the bottom.  Patiently waiting. I wonder if He ever says, “Look at him go, he is really up there. He really thinks he has it figured out this time.” Or as the good shepherd, does he have to come up the ladder and guide me back down and help me move the ladder to his wall? </p><p></p><p> John 10:14-16 is so powerful.  </p><blockquote><p><em>“I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me— just as the Father knows me and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for the sheep. </em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.”</em></p></blockquote><p></p><p>“I know my sheep”.  The good shepherd knows me! He knows what I want and He gives me His peace freely, if I am willing to accept it and keep the ladder on His wall. </p><p>(By the way, doesn’t verse 16 make you want to get your hands dirty for the Kingdom? “I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also.”)<br/><br/>A central part of John 10:14 is “and my sheep know me.” It could arguably be read as a directive. “You need to know me as I know you.”  </p><p>How do we know him?  We fix our eyes on Him. We spend time with Him daily, without fail.  We talk with Him. We trust Him with our finances, our careers, our families. We stop moving and we listen. </p><blockquote><p><em>“Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is — his good, pleasing and perfect will.”   —Romans 12:2</em></p></blockquote><p>This is the key to a life without want, that we fix our minds on Christ– our Good Shepherd, who gives us <em>His</em> peace without restraint.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chip Measells</p><p>Executive Director &amp; Legacy Team Leader</p><p>The Point Church </p><p><br/><br/><br/></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1666713703906-JKKJ331MSAE362K79PHX/unsplash-image-YjVa-F9P9kk.jpg,390

<p>God who controls history determined Jesus to be born in this obscure village, but why? The quick answer: to fulfill His prophecy (Micah 5:2) as echoed in the gospels. Yet, long before Micah declared this Word of the Lord, God intricately prepared a message that only this ancient town can preach. It’s a message about faith and it begins with the first mention of Bethlehem in scripture. </p><p>This first mention found in Genesis 35:19 explains that Rachel, who was Jesus’ great-grandmother many times over, was buried along the road near Bethlehem. This is the same road that God’s people would follow into exile centuries later.</p><p>Tradition tells us that they would stop near Bethlehem at Rachel’s grave to pray for salvation. They had faith God would keep His promise to return them to their homeland.

This is what the ancients were commended for.” Hebrews 11:1-2</p></blockquote><p>God did return His people to their promised land, yet even more so, <em>“when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son…” </em>(Galatians 4:4) God answered their faith-filled prayers for salvation beyond even what they hoped. </p><p>Jesus the Messiah could have been born anywhere He chose, but perhaps He was drawn to Bethlehem due to the generations of faith-filled believers and prayers in that location. </p><blockquote><p><em>“And without faith, it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.” </em>(Hebrews 11:6) </p></blockquote><p>Are you believing God when you draw near to Him?

Considering God inspired the titles reflective of His one and only Son’s nature, we are wise to pay attention to them.</p><p>So in this chaotic world, what does it mean that Jesus is the Prince of Peace?</p><p>It reveals we are incapable of creating our own peace. Jesus as the Prince of Peace implies that peace belongs to him and it’s his alone to bestow.</p><p>Do you recall how Jesus slept in a fishing boat in the middle of a furious storm (see Matthew 8:23-27)?</p><p>Jesus rebuked the wind and the waves, and then there was complete calm and peace. In the midst of that fear and chaos, Jesus made himself known to his disciples as the Prince of Peace.</p><p>Jesus has not ceased caring for and revealing himself to those who follow him. Jesus said, “Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.” (John 14:21) Other translations use the words reveal, show; the Amplified Bible translation says, <em>“I will make Myself real to him.”</em></p><p>On the evening of that raging storm, the disciples perhaps overlooked who was with them. Let's be different in this regard by the power of the Holy Spirit. Ask God for grace to remember that He is your constant companion and yield to His leading. Obey. In return, He will reveal His presence with you, and life’s undercurrent will grow increasingly tranquil despite circumstances.</p><blockquote><p><em>“the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you. Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you.” </em>(John 14:26-27)</p></blockquote><h3>PRAYER</h3><p>Glorious Father, thank You for adopting me as your child and renaming me “Beloved” (Romans 9:25). Thank You that because of Jesus my Savior I can experience true peace. I ask for the grace to remember Your presence with me and grace to obey. Please help me to experience the peace that comes from You. Amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1671647465078-81SJ884VTL1DUHQ22SDN/Advent+Series+Lobby+Wall.png,396
397,The Bigger Picture,post,2022-03-03 17:10:45,,/blogfeed/2022/3/3/the-bigger-picture,<p>This blog was written by Amanda Eheart.</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading:</strong> “We can make our plans, but the Lord determines our steps (Proverbs 16:9, <em>NLT</em>).”</p><p>Have you ever been asked the question, “Where do you see yourself in ____ years?” Are you actually where you thought you would be ____ years ago?</p><p>If you had asked me that question however many years ago I would have told you that I would be working a job that I loved, making enough money to live comfortably. I would be married, with at least one child (hopefully more), a dog or two (maybe a cat) in a nice house. Nothing wrong with this right? Of course not!  </p><p>Am I there… NOPE! I have a job that I love but no husband, no children, no pets, no home of my own. When you grow up being told you are worthless, stupid, ugly, fat and so many other negaitive things this can send you to a very dark place – and it did. I honestly believed that the reason I didn’t get these things was because the cruel things I was told as I was growing up were true. And because I believed this, I made some bad choices and tried to put a wall up between myself, God and everyone else, because they all must believe this about me, too. This just helped with the downward spiral of loneliness and negativity. I had good days but there were so many more bad days. I wasn’t sure I would ever get out of the hole I felt I was in. My “human” heart told me that my plans didn’t work out because there was something wrong with me. My “Jesus” heart reminded me that there is a reason things did not work out the way I planned them.</p><p>You know what I love about God? He can use the simplest of things to teach you the biggest lessons. While organizing the donated school supplies into piles of like items and then into separate piles for each school we were supporting, He made things make sense in such a real way. What I thought was only going to take an hour or two took almost 9 hours! I would get one item organized and felt a sense of accomplishment only to stand up and see all of the other items waiting to be sorted. It was very overwhelming and discouraging; but as frustrated as I was, I realized that if I had just focused on where I was and not worried about what was next it wouldn’t have been so overwhelming and discouraging.  </p><p>It’s the same way with our plans. We aren’t meant to worry about what is next. It would overwhelm us too much. Instead, the Bible shows us that our God is not only ever-present but that He supplies our every need (Matthew 6:33-34). The Lord promised to never leave nor forsake the Israelites in Deuteronomy 31 – and He makes the same promise to us today. So, with every plan that you and I make, we can trust that God is walking with us every step of the way, determining our steps according to His goodness.</p><p><strong><em>God, help us to be content with where you have us now but still excited about what’s to come. Your plans are so much more amazing than anything we can plan for ourselves, so help us to trust in obedience that Your ways are higher than our ways. Give us strength as we wait on You! </em></strong></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1646327373379-HT5IR74ZFI72QUBJ55IQ/The+bigger+picture.jpg,398
399,The Object of Faith,post,2022-04-22 12:06:58,,/blogfeed/2022/4/22/the-object-of-faith,<p>This blog was written by Bonnie Russman.</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture Reading</strong>:  “For she thought, ‘If I just touch the hem of His garment, I shall get well.’  And immediately . . . she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.” (Mark 5:28-29)</p><p>Growing up, our family enjoyed watching the popular television series Superman; however, my younger brother was particularly keen. He begged for his own Superman cape – and finally my mother took an old bath towel, drew a giant “S” on it, and tied it around his neck.  Moments later, as she was washing dishes, she spotted my brother “flying” past the kitchen window in a rapid descent to the ground, from the roof – his “cape” barely flapping in the breeze! It must have made perfect sense to him: he loved Superman. And, as the child that he was, he put all his faith in that cape – believing it would let him fly.</p><p>In today’s story (see Mark 25-34), this woman exhibited tremendous faith. Having had a hemorrhage for 12 years, she was not only physically ill, but according to Levitical law was marked as unclean: a social outcast. Can you imagine her loneliness and desperation to be made well? But, “after hearing about Jesus,” her faith in Him was ignited – a faith so strong and sure that her healing came about before Jesus even saw her or touched her. Reaching out, she literally tapped into his power and mercy. Even Jesus confirmed that it was her faith that had made her well (v. 34): faith in HIM!</p><p>Let’s look briefly at the kind of faith the woman had in our story:</p><p>1. Her faith was <em>bold</em>. She muscled her way through the crowd, in spite of her situation in life, and did whatever she had to do in order to access Jesus – her only hope.</p><p>2. Her faith was <em>focused</em>. She wanted Jesus and no other and refused to be distracted or deterred from her goal. She didn’t care about the consequences.</p><p>3. Her faith was <em>humble</em>. It’s interesting that she positioned herself to touch the hem, or bottom part of the garment, near Jesus’ feet. This means she bowed not before him, but behind him – the ultimate expression of humility.</p><p>4. Her faith was <em>expectant</em>. She thought (believed), “If I just touch the hem of His garment, I shall get well.” No doubts, no ifs or maybes, but “I SHALL get well.”</p><p>If you’re like me, your faith is often less than bold, focused, humble, and expectant. But, God is able! He is able to increase our faith if we ask, and He loves to give good gifts to his children (Matt. 7:11). The gift of faith is one of his very best.  </p><p>Let’s face it, this world offers us all kinds of super-heroes to trust and believe in, and most of them don’t fly around wearing capes! We can place our trust in people, institutions, ideologies, religion, finances, and accomplishments – but they cannot save.  </p><p>Charles Spurgeon said it well, “What is the object of faith, then? It is a person, a living, divine, appointed person. And who is that person? He is none other than Jesus.”  </p><p><strong><em>Thank you, Lord, for your wonderful gift of faith. Help me to grow in that faith, becoming more certain of you each day, trusting in you alone with all my heart, reaching out to you and claiming your power and mercy, resting in your everlasting goodness and love. Amen.</em></strong></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1650629149413-9CYP2PBP7VEDD4OV8SA5/The+Object+of+Faith.jpg,400
401,Power of Prayer and Fasting&amp;nbsp;,post,2023-01-10 17:11:57,,/blogfeed/2023/1/10/power-of-prayer-and-fastingnbsp,"<p>As we embark on a new year, it's a perfect time to reflect on the past and set our sights on the future.</p>","<h1>Power of Prayer and Fasting </h1><p><br/></p><p>As we embark on a new year, it's a perfect time to reflect on the past and set our sights on the future. One thing that has always been a constant in my life, and has brought me great comfort and strength, is the power of prayer. Prayer is such a crucial part of our spiritual formation and it has the ability to transform our lives in immeasurable ways.</p><p>When we pray, we are able to connect with God and seek His guidance and wisdom. James 1:5 tells us,</p><blockquote><p> ""If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you."" </p></blockquote><p>How amazing is that? God is always ready and willing to give us the wisdom and guidance we need, we just have to ask.</p><p>Prayer is also a way for us to offer up our praise and thanksgiving to God. In Psalm 34:1, it says, </p><blockquote><p>""I will extol the Lord at all times; his praise will always be on my lips."" </p></blockquote><p>When we offer up our praise to God, it helps to shift our focus from our own problems and onto all that God has done for us. It's a reminder of His faithfulness and goodness.</p><p>But prayer isn't just about asking God for things or offering up our praise. It's also about seeking transformation in our own lives. In Philippians 4:6-7, it says, </p><blockquote><p>""Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."" </p></blockquote><p>When we pray and present our requests to God, it helps to ease our anxiety and brings us a sense of peace.</p><p>Prayer is such a powerful tool, and when we pray consistently, it can have a profound impact on our lives. But have you ever considered taking your prayer life to the next level through fasting? Fasting is a way to set aside physical pleasures and focus on seeking God. It's a way to humble ourselves before God and to put Him first in our lives.</p><p>In Matthew 6:16-18, it says, </p><blockquote><p>""When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.""</p></blockquote><p>Fasting isn't about seeking attention or accolades from others, it's about seeking a deeper connection with God. When we fast, we are able to set aside the distractions of the world and focus on seeking God's will for our lives. It's a way to draw closer to Him and to seek His guidance and wisdom.</p><p>So as we embark on a new year, I encourage you to make prayer and fasting a priority. </p><p>Everything is better, and anything is possible, when we pray. Don't be afraid to bring your needs, your praise, and your requests to God. He is ready and willing to hear from you and to guide you on your journey. </p><p>Trust in Him and have faith that He will lead you down the path that is best for you.</p><p><br/><br/></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1673371584786-FIP1UPY1EJM0IITAGH3D/PrayFirst_square.jpg,402
403,Prayer &amp;amp; The Word&amp;nbsp;,post,2023-01-19 20:48:00,,/blogfeed/2023/1/19/prayer-amp-the-wordnbsp,<p>A Blog by Kristin Fields </p>,"<h1>Prayer &amp; The Word </h1><blockquote><p><em>“This is the confidence we have before him: If we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. And if we know that he hears whatever we ask, we know that we have what we have asked of him.” </em>(1 John 5:14-15) </p></blockquote><p>I remember when my father would give guidance or a promise of some kind, I would often return to Him with the reminder, “Dad, you said…” God, who is the perfect parent, knows exactly what we need even before we ask, but as our Father He wants us to come to Him in complete dependence. We see this exemplified in Jesus’ life. </p><h3>Prayer was central in Jesus’ life with God, second to none. </h3><p>He made time for it and often stayed up all night praying. I find it fascinating as well that of all the things the disciples could ask Jesus to teach them to do, he was asked to teach them to pray (Luke 11:1)! If Jesus’ life revolved around communing and enjoying His Father in prayer and yielded such incredible Kingdom results, our lives are meant to as well. </p><p>Because of Christ’s sacrifice, you are invited to come boldly to God’s throne of grace with all sorts of prayers. We have been seated with Christ in the heavenly realms. We have been spiritually positioned in such a way that we have the gracious ear of God. And because God has no favorite children (Romans 2:11), you can be confident that He welcomes your company and conversation. </p><p>Timothy teaches that all scripture is God-breathed (2 Timothy 3:16). It is the inspired, life-giving, timeless revelation God intends for you - as if His words were just spoken directly to you. When we bring to our Heavenly Father what He has shared in scripture, it’s as if we are coming to Him saying, “Dad, you said…” When we pray like this we are agreeing with what He has revealed and spoken in alignment with His words, will, or example. </p><p>Here’s an example of how I pray God’s Word.</p><p>As I read my Bible, I write my children’s initials next to verses pertaining to the kind of character I desire for the Lord to grow in them. When I pray these scriptures, I am confident and expectant knowing that this is God’s heart for them as well. </p><p>Heavenly Father, please <em>conform my children to the image of Your Son </em>(Romans 8:29). Jesus, I pray that they will <em>abide in You </em>(John 15:5) and <em>bear much fruit to Your glory </em>(Gal. 5:22-23). I pray they have <em>a different spirit and follow You fully </em>(Num. 14:24). Empower them to <em>live by Your Spirit and walk by Your Spirit </em>(Gal. 5:25). Father, please <em>increase my children in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man </em>just as Jesus grew (Luke 2:52).</p><h3>Praying scripture is powerful! </h3><p>It’s a reminder to yourself and God of your dependency on Him to shape whatever you are asking in prayer. With a mouthful of His Words, your thoughts and motivations begin to harmonize with your Heavenly Father, and just like Jesus prayer becomes one of your greatest joys. </p><h3>Prayer: </h3><p>Heavenly Father, thank You for the gift of Your Word and Your Spirit which help me to pray according to Your will. I praise You for such an incredible privilege. Lord Jesus, teach ME how to pray! I love You. Amen.</p><p><br/></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1673371584786-FIP1UPY1EJM0IITAGH3D/PrayFirst_square.jpg,404
405,Prayer and Fasting,post,2023-01-19 17:58:54,,/blogfeed/2023/1/19/prayer-and-fasting,<p>A blog by Kristin Fields </p>,"<h1>Prayer &amp; Fasting </h1><blockquote><p><em>“Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer; you shall cry for help, and he will say, “Here I am…. The Lord will guide you continually” </em>(Isaiah 58:9, 11 NRSV) </p></blockquote><p>Tools are pathways to infinite creativity. They have the potential when used to build, influence, and bring about something with lasting benefit. Jesus has passed on two spiritual power tools to those who choose to follow his example - fasting and praying. </p><p>Jesus taught, <em>“When you fast…;” </em>implying his disciples would indeed fast and pray (Matthew 6:16). By putting these tools to use, we are led deeper into friendship with God who strengthens us and brings us into alignment with Him in order to continue the ministry of Christ and experience abundant life. </p><h3>A fast is a voluntary practice of setting aside food, a source of nourishment and pleasure, for the Source who loves you. </h3><p>It is guided by the genuine intention of drawing nearer to God with increased sensitivity. You are invited by the Lord to fast and pray for any reason within His will. A few common themes found in scripture are: </p><ul data-rte-list=""default""><li><p>Repentance: Bringing your body into submission through self-denial is a picture of your whole being turning away from disordered desires and toward your heavenly Father. In doing so you are fasting and praying to be released from spiritual bondage into His freedom. Seek God’s will and strength in order to align yourself with Him. </p></li><li><p>Renewal: You may feel far from God, or you may encounter a wilderness season when God feels absent. Life may feel fruitless. Enter into a fast seeking God’s thoughts and feelings by desiring communion with Him. Pray for your heart to be softened, to experience His love, and to love Him in return. </p></li><li><p>Reengagement: Consider Jesus’ compassion for the lost, prodigal, sick, lonely, and marginalized. When lacking empathy for the things that break God’s heart, fast and pray to experience the Lord’s sorrow and become an active participant in His plan of redemption. Ask for a heart like His and seek His direction. </p></li><li><p>Relief: Fasting can be a way to move through tidal waves of grief. Time set aside to feel your pain with God with fasting and prayer is a form of lament. Ask God to comfort and minister His compassion to you by sharing His thoughts, shifting you into greater intimacy with Him. To experience Jesus with you in your pain through fasting and prayer can be a catalyst for healing. </p></li></ul><p>Our reasons to fast are personal and numerous, but perhaps this brief list will help you identify the fast to which the Lord is calling you.</p><p>Whatever your reason may be, we are blessed to remember that by fasting and praying we are declaring mastery over our nature so that we will live directed by the <em>“power of the Spirit” </em>(Luke 10:21). What a thrill that we’ve been given spiritual power tools by the Master Creator, taught by Him, and invited into this powerful work with our Savior. </p><h3>Prayer<strong> </strong></h3><p>Lord Jesus, you are so generous! Thank you for hearing from me and receiving me. I chose to follow in your footsteps by fasting and praying that <em>“Your kingdom come. You will be done on earth </em>[and in me] <em>as it is in heaven.” </em>(Matt. 6:10) Amen.</p><p><br/></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1673371584786-FIP1UPY1EJM0IITAGH3D/PrayFirst_square.jpg,406
407,Why Baptism?,post,2023-01-19 14:00:00,,/blogfeed/2023/1/19/why-baptism,,"<h1>Baptism</h1><p>Many people come to faith in Christ at different points in their lives, and for some, the decision to be baptized may not have come right away. But regardless of when or where you accepted Christ, or whether you have been baptized before, we want to encourage you to consider taking this important step of going public with your faith through baptism.</p><h2>Baptism is an outward expression of an inward decision to follow Jesus Christ.</h2><p>It is a powerful symbol of new beginnings, and it marks the start of a journey of growing closer to God and becoming more like Him. In baptism, we publicly proclaim our faith in Jesus and the change He has made in our lives.</p><p>The Bible is clear about the importance of baptism. </p><p>In Matthew 28:19, Jesus commands his followers to baptize others in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and in Acts 22:16, the Apostle Paul is told by Ananias ""And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name."" . So, baptism is not just a tradition, it is a command from our Lord, Jesus himself.</p><p>If you have accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, but have never been baptized, we want you to know that <strong>you are not alone.</strong> There are many people in the same situation, and we would be honored to stand alongside you as you take this important step of faith. Being baptized is not just for new believers, it is for anyone who wants to publicly identify themselves with Jesus, regardless of their past.</p><h2>Baptism is a powerful way to start your journey as a follower of Jesus.</h2><p>It marks the start of a new chapter in your life and is a powerful reminder of the change Jesus has made in you.

(2 Corinthians 5:17).</p></blockquote><p>We would love to have the opportunity to stand with you as you go public with your faith. Let us know if you are ready to take the step of being baptized and we will be more than happy to help you make this decision! We believe that your baptism will be a day you will never forget, a moment that you will look back on with joy.</p><p>We hope you will consider taking this step and going public with your faith through baptism.</p><p></p>

These practices have the power to transform us and to guide us on our journey with God.</p>","<h1>The Power of Prayer, Community and Confession</h1><p>As believers, it's so important for us to make prayer, community, and confession a part of our daily lives. These practices have the power to transform us and to guide us on our journey with God. In this blog, I want to talk about the importance of returning to these disciplines and how they can help us grow closer to God.</p><h3>First, let's talk about the importance of<strong> prayer.</strong></h3><p>Prayer is a way for us to connect with God and to seek His guidance and wisdom. In Philippians 4:6-7, it says,</p><blockquote><p> ""Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."" </p></blockquote><h3>When we pray, it helps to ease our anxiety and brings us a sense of peace.</h3><p>But sometimes, we can get undisciplined in our prayer lives. We get busy with the demands of life and we let our prayer time slip away. That's why it's so important to make a conscious effort to return to the discipline of prayer. Set aside a specific time each day to pray and make it a priority. It could be first thing in the morning, before you go to bed, or any time that works for you. The important thing is to be consistent and to make it a part of your daily routine.</p><p>Another important discipline is <strong>community</strong>. We were not meant to journey through life alone. In Ecclesiastes 4:9-10, it says, </p><blockquote><p>""Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up."" </p></blockquote><p>When we have a community of believers around us, it helps to lift us up and to encourage us when we're facing challenges. It also helps to hold us accountable and to help us grow in our faith.</p><p>But just like with prayer, it's easy to get undisciplined in our relationships with our community of believers. We may not make time for fellowship or we may neglect our relationships with others. That's why it's so important to make a conscious effort to return to the discipline of community. Make time for fellowship, either through small groups or one-on-one relationships. And don't be afraid to be vulnerable with others. When we open up and share our struggles and our victories, it helps to build deeper connections and to encourage one another in our faith.</p><h3>Finally, let's talk about the importance of<strong> confession.</strong> </h3><p>We all sin and we all fall short of God's perfect standard. But when we confess our sin and turn away from it, it helps to restore our relationship with God. In 1 John 1:9, it says, </p><blockquote><p>""If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness."" </p></blockquote><h3>Confession is a crucial part of our spiritual growth and it helps to keep us close to God.</h3><p>But just like with prayer and community, it's easy to get undisciplined in our confession. We may try to hide our sin or we may try to justify it. But it's so important to return to the discipline of confession. When we confess our sin, it helps to keep us humble and it helps to keep us close to God. It's not about trying to earn God's forgiveness, it's about recognizing our need for it and seeking it out.</p><p>So as you embark on a new year, I encourage you to make prayer, community, and confession a priority. We've all grown undisciplined in these areas at some point, but it's never too late to return to them. </p><h3>Trust in God and have faith that He will use these disciplines to transform you and to guide you on your journey with Him.</h3><p><br/></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1673371584786-FIP1UPY1EJM0IITAGH3D/PrayFirst_square.jpg,410
411,Prayer and Confession,post,2023-01-30 18:18:06,,/blogfeed/2023/1/30/prayer-and-confession,<p>A Blog by Kristin Fields</p>,"<h1>Prayer &amp; Confession </h1><p>A decade ago, I shared with a trusted friend the temptation and skewed thinking I was battling. It was a slippery slope, and I was miserable. I don’t recall the details of the conversation, but my friend listened and her response was compassionate; without a doubt she prayed.</p><p>What I know for certain is that I was invited to meet with her in a weekly small group to pray and read 1 John. This spiritual mother led me to the Word that ultimately renewed my broken mind. That is the power of confession in Christian community. Since then, I have learned to keep a short account with God through daily confession in prayer, and if necessary, in Christian community for support. </p><p>Like Adam and Eve, we have the freedom to hide our sin and our weaknesses. However, we also have the freedom to confess, bringing our struggles into the healing light of Christ. When we confess our sin to God we are forgiven, cleansed, and given a fresh start. </p><blockquote><p><em>“If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” </em>(1 John 1:9) </p></blockquote><h2>Confession is asking Christ to wash us clean, not wallowing in shame and condemnation. It’s running to God and it’s good news. </h2><p>Keep in mind, our battle with temptation is more like a war than a skirmish. Believing God is not withholding something good from you can be a challenge. This is when we wish there was an easy way out, but you were not made for easy. You were made for intimacy; intimacy with God and intimacy within the family of God. Engaging in Christian community through prayer and confession is vital to living a dynamic life with Christ. </p><p>Years ago I read an account of an African tribe that would surround a guilty person and proceed to remind them of who they are apart from their mistake. They were cared for and known.

My grandparents had a box that held bits and pieces of newspaper clippings and souvenirs; evidence of decades and centuries past.

God is Creator and Sustainer of all things, so for what would He be thankful?</p><p>In Luke 15, the lost sheep, the lost coin, the lost son represent you. God is represented by the shepherd, the woman, and the father, who are not content moving on with the other ninety-nine sheep, the other nine coins, and the other son, until what was lost is found. These lost things are valuable to the owners.</p><p><em>“For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”</em> (Luke 19:10) </p><p>To be separate from God is not only reckless, but it also equates death.

Here on earth, you will have many trials and sorrows.  But take heart, because I have overcome the world.”  John 16:33</em> </p></blockquote><p>“...that you may have peace...” The word “may” in the original Greek language is <em>echo.</em> It implies that someone is “to have and to hold” a thing. Sound familiar? In a traditional marriage ceremony, each person echoes a vow to have and to hold one another as if they are one entity. </p><p>Dear believer in Jesus Christ, God has forgiven you. He has made peace with you through Christ so He can have you and hold you. As your Heavenly Father, He has vowed Himself to you throughout scripture. Christ will never leave those who entrust their lives to Him (John 14:16, Matthew 28:20). Because of Jesus, you are completely forgiven and now one with God. </p><p>The way God views you is fundamentally different than before you placed your trust in Christ, but only because for <em>“our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of God” (2 Cor 5:21).</em> </p><p>Since you have been forgiven, saved, born again, redeemed, and justified, God, knows you as He intended – a reflection of His Son! </p><blockquote><p><em>“For we are God’s masterpiece.

This can be done in many ways, and one of the most effective ways is by <strong><em>Getting Your Hands on The Net</em></strong>. </p><p>This phrase, taken from Matthew 4:19, means to be proactive in reaching out to others and sharing the hope and truth of the Gospel. One of the best ways to do this is by serving on a Dream Team at The Point Church.</p><p>In 1 Peter 4:10, we are told that we have each been given a spiritual gift, which is meant to be used to serve others. <strong><em>When we serve others, we are fulfilling our calling and purpose as Christians.</em></strong> We are also building relationships and making a positive impact on the world around us. </p><p>As Mother Teresa once said,</p><blockquote><p>""I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples.""</p></blockquote><p>Serving on a dream team at The Point Church is a great way to <strong><em>Get Your Hands on The Net</em></strong> and serve others. The Dream Team is made up of people who have discovered their gifts and passions and are actively serving in them. Whether you have a gift for creating a comfortable environment for others, leading the next generation to Jesus, crafting a dynamic worship experience, or tearing down barriers in your community, there is a place for you on the Dream Team.</p><p>As famous Christian author and pastor, Rick Warren once said, </p><blockquote><p>""You were created to make a difference in this world. God designed you to use your gifts, talents, and resources to fulfill a unique purpose."" </p></blockquote><p>By serving on a Dream Team, you are fulfilling that purpose and making a positive impact on the world around you.</p><p>Another benefit of serving on a Dream Team is the opportunity for personal growth and spiritual development. When we step out of our comfort zones and serve others, we are challenged to rely on God and trust in His plan for our lives. As John C. Maxwell once said, </p><blockquote><p>""Life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it."" </p></blockquote><p>Serving on a dream team can help us develop a positive and proactive attitude toward life, as we learn to trust in God's plan for us.</p><p>Finally, serving on a dream team can bring joy and fulfillment into our lives. As Jesus said in Acts 20:35, ""It is more blessed to give than to receive."" When we serve others, we are giving of ourselves and making a positive impact on the world around us. This brings joy and fulfillment into our lives, as we know that we are living out our purpose and making a difference in the world.</p><h3><strong><em>Getting your hands on the net</em></strong> means being proactive in sharing the hope and truth of the Gospel with others.</h3><p>Serving on a Dream Team at The Point Church is a great way to do this, and it offers many benefits, including fulfilling our purpose as Christians, building relationships, personal growth, and bringing joy and fulfillment into our lives. As William Arthur Ward once said, ""The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires."" </p><p>By serving on a Dream Team, we can be great teachers, inspiring others to live out their purpose and make a positive impact on the world around them.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/bdfb2738-f185-47aa-9238-d04890d8cc25/GT+Website.png,428
429,Completely Forgiving,post,2023-02-28 19:42:38,,/blogfeed/2023/2/28/completely-forgiving,<p>A Blog by Kristin Fields</p>,"<p>How do you relieve a bruise after running into a corner? Aside from what words might escape your lips, typically the next thought is to apply ice to reduce swelling. Trauma produces inflammation and if you control inflammation, you control the degree of damage. Following that train of thought, how do you nurse a wounded, inflamed heart? The Lord Jesus tells us to apply forgiveness.<br/><br/>Forgiveness is often more than a ""one and done"" kind of decision. It is a willful choice, often repeated, to not pay back the pain someone has caused you. After that initial choice to forgive, trusting God to deal with your offender, how do you stop the residual anger and bitterness from engulfing your heart?<br/><br/>We find a solution in the parable of the unforgiving servant. </p><blockquote><p>Jesus said, <em>""Then the master of that servant had compassion, released him, and forgave him the loan."" (Matthew 18:27)</em> </p></blockquote><p>The man’s heart was moved with compassion before he released his debtor. <br/><br/>In scripture “compassion” is used to describe Jesus' heart before many of his miracles. Jesus experienced compassion before healing, teaching, feeding, and forgiving people, including those who were happy to torture him. In each instance, Jesus experienced compassion before releasing God’s mercy. <br/><br/><strong>By placing your faith in Christ, you too are a recipient of his miraculous compassion and mercy!</strong> <br/><br/>So you have something in common with the one who has sinned against you: the propensity to sin and the need for forgiveness. Relating in this way is not only humbling, but it empowers you to apply Christ's compassion to your perpetrator and quench the fire of unforgiveness. From this awareness you “forgive your brother from your heart.” (Luke 18:35) This does not imply restoration or trust. Prayerfully seek the Lord’s will in moving forward.</p><h3>Guidance to Forgiving from Your Heart:</h3><p>1. <em>""Set your mind on things that are above, not on things that are on earth."" (Colossians 3:2)</em> First, recognize the miracle of Christ's compassion specifically to you through His saving power. <br/><br/>2. <em>""Therefore, put to death... put away all the following: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and filthy <br/>language from your mouth."" (Col. 3:5, 8)</em> Repent and ask God to transform you. Depend on Him <br/>to lead you in His ways.<br/><br/>3. <em>""Therefore, as God’s chosen ones, holy and dearly loved, put on compassion, <br/>kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience, bearing with one another and forgiving one <br/>another if anyone has a grievance against another. Just as the Lord has forgiven you, so you are also to forgive."" (Col. 3:12-13) As a follower of Christ choose to live out your new identity – his character and compassion. Pu</em>tting to death old ways of dealing with pain is not easy, but scripture says you are a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). If you are willing, there is grace to completely forgive like Jesus.

433,When we REACH,post,2023-02-09 20:30:40,,/blogfeed/2023/2/9/when-we-reach,<p>A blog by Kristin Fields </p>,"<blockquote><p>“What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save<br/>him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.” (James 2:14-17)</p></blockquote><p><br/>Daily I see a neighbor helping others: bringing a meal to an elderly shut-in, assisting a single mom with her responsibilities, lending a hand with yard work, and in general, being an exceptional neighbor. He is a beautiful influence and he is not a Christian.</p><p><br/>A person does not need the Holy Spirit to make a difference. <strong>However, the Holy Spirit empowers a believer to help in the name of Christ, producing His fruit,</strong> <strong>and pointing people to the Lord rather than<br/>themselves.</strong> </p><blockquote><p>“In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works<br/>and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.” (Matthew 5:16)</p></blockquote><h3> Our faith is meant to make a physical difference; it’s meant to do some good.</h3><p><br/>The help you give in Jesus’ name is “evidence of things unseen.” (Hebrews 11:1). God, who has revealed Himself through scripture and in the person of Jesus Christ, also reveals His existence through you when you meet others’ needs. In fulfilling a tangible need, a door often opens to minister the compassion and hope of Jesus Christ. The gospel becomes known and meaningful to others through your help.</p><p><br/>First John 4 shares that if you “have come to know and to believe the love that God has for [you],” you will love others as you love yourself (Matthew 22:39). When the Son of God walked the earth as a neighbor, he “went around doing good.” (Acts 10:38) In fact, as a believer you have been born again “created in Christ for good works, which God prepared ahead of time for [you] to do.” (Ephesians 2:10)</p><h3><br/>You have been entrusted with God’s love, example, and assignment!</h3><p><br/>Beyond helping your neighbor, there are numerous ways for you to minister Christ’s compassion at The Point. Our REACH small groups serve local underprivileged and underserved neighborhoods that include refugees. Mission trips are open to join and opportunities to financially support our REACH partners in 13 countries.</p><p><br/>Just imagine how God will bless people as you ask Him to highlight your opportunities to love and do good. Look for ways to help. Remember, putting action to those thoughts offers evidence of His love. <strong>Your community will be touched by God as you love your neighbors just like Jesus.</strong><br/></p><h3>Prayer:</h3><p>Heavenly Father, thank You for the gift of salvation in Jesus Christ and Your Holy Spirit. Please fill me with compassion and make me a vessel of Your love. Shine Your light on the good works you want me to do for Your glory. I want to give others the hope and joy of loving Jesus. Amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/27ab0e2a-1395-471c-a437-6b834fdd0084/ToyDrive-39.jpg,434

It is the note I tuck into his bag just before meets. We both know that if he watches his peers he could be discouraged, the next casualty on the track, or even disqualify himself.</p><blockquote><p><em>""Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a huge crowd of witnesses to the life of faith, let us strip off every weight that slows us down, especially the sin that so easily trips us up. And let us run with endurance the race God has set before us."" </em>(Hebrews 12:1 NLT) </p></blockquote><p>God has set you in your lane with everything needed for a dynamic life with Him. If you are not careful though, you may jump lanes from ""love your neighbor"" to ""watch your neighbor"" without a second thought.</p><p>This habit is a hard one to break because it is human nature to compare to find significance. When we measure ourselves against people, sadly we apply a value system God did not create. As a result, we tend to fall into the pits of self-criticism or self-exaltation.</p><p>In contrast, imagining who you can become because of Jesus Christ is a healthy comparison.</p><blockquote><p> ""<em>The LORD will work out his plans for my life— for your faithful love, O LORD, endures forever."" </em>(Psalm 138:8) </p></blockquote><p>This type of comparison shifts your perspective to better see that God is your Source of every blessing and success, not yourself.</p><p>When you are tempted to compare yourself to another person, instead of feeling envious or self-loathsome, combat those lies with the opposite spirit. Give sincere congratulations, and heart that darn picture on social media. Look for God's goodness and ask Him to reorient you to your lane.</p><h3>Your significance lies in being one infinitely valued by your Heavenly Father. He is at work in your life. </h3><p>Dallas Willard wrote, </p><blockquote><p>“The obviously well-kept secret of the ‘ordinary’ is that it is made to be a receptacle of the divine, a place where the life of God flows.” </p></blockquote><p>Remember God does not look to your left or right. You have a tremendous crowd cheering you on (Heb. 12:1). Find your lane and run your race.</p><h3>Prayer:</h3><p>Heavenly Father, please help me not to compare myself to others. You are my Source. Lord Jesus, grace me to run my race and keep my eyes on You. Amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1678046884202-WU0JUBWTYP56QJBY7YGB/INYIM_screen.jpg,436

439,What Will Jesus Find?,post,2023-03-17 19:15:05,,/blogfeed/2023/3/17/what-what-jesus-find,<p>A blog by Kristin Fields</p>,"<p><em>""May no one ever eat fruit from you again.""</em> (Mark 11:14) Jesus said this to a lone fig tree near the road he and his disciples were travelling. Imagining myself in the scene, I fear I would have been that impulsive disciple piping up with, ""Lord, that’s pretty harsh!” Was Jesus truly angry that a tree did not produce fruit out of season?<br/><br/>Although Jesus was fully human, He was also fully God. God who is slow to anger. We can be certain that any frustration with this verse is due to our limited knowledge, not the nature of Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>The details in Mark 11:12-14 lead us to better understand what Jesus was saying. Scripture says it was <em>""a fig tree in leaf""</em> and <em>""that he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.""</em> (vv. 12-13) <br/><br/>As leaves start to unfurl on fig trees, little knobs also form. They drop from the tree prior to the figs’ fruition. These were a favorite source of food for travelers of Jesus' time. You can picture a single fig tree on the horizon full of bright green leaves and the promise of a delicious snack. <br/><br/>The fact that there were no knobs on this beckoning tree shows it was unhealthy and perhaps dying regardless of how it looked on the outside. Jesus was simply declaring the obvious. He was using this fig tree as an illustration to confront his disciples - and still does.<br/>Keep in mind this occurs just before Jesus enters the temple to clear it. Standing in the Court of the Gentiles, where people from all nations worshiped God, Jesus finds hundreds of people making business transactions and busy with religiosity. <br/><br/>Jesus drove out these hypocrites flipping over their tables and chairs. He even stopped them from taking irreverent shortcuts through the temple. He then boldly taught from the prophet Isaiah who said, <em>“And the foreigners who join themselves to the Lord, to minister to him, to love the name of the Lord, and to be his servants, everyone who keeps the Sabbath and does not profane it, and holds fast my covenant — these I will bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar;  for   my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples .”</em> (Isaiah 65:6-7)<br/><br/>Like the fig tree, Jesus found no spiritual fruit in the temple. It was full of religious people taking their work and busyness very seriously; however, people intimate with God were not found. The people of God looked as though they were in full bloom, but they were not fulfilling their purpose. </p><blockquote><p><em>It is a tremendous thought that if you trust Jesus Christ as Savior, you are now ""a temple of the Holy Spirit."" (1 Corinthians 6:19) He lives in you. </em></p></blockquote><p>Having been grafted to Christ, He has made a way to bear much fruit through you. You can now be a healthy branch abiding in God. <em>""This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples."" </em>(John 15:8)<br/><br/>Realize that God longs for you to share the fruit of being in relationship with Him. Jesus Christ <br/>strategically chose you to reveal Him at this time! (John 15:16) The Holy Spirit equips and empowers you to yield fruit that will feed your generation. What will Jesus find when he looks at your life?</p><h3>Prayer</h3>

441,Lonely,post,2023-03-02 21:40:32,,/blogfeed/2023/3/2/lonely,<p>A Blog by Kristin Fields </p>,"<p>Imagine a child without a sin nature or selfish motivation. Before you claim to know that perfect tyke, consider what an oddball that likely would make him or her. I mean, peers and siblings might have a hard time relating to the kid. Now, imagine a teen equally pure hearted and acutely sensitive to sin and evil. Likely, feeling misunderstood, disconnected, and lonely would be a regular experience. As an exceptionally unique person, it makes sense to me that Jesus may have been well acquainted with loneliness even as a child.</p><blockquote><p>Scripture testifies that as an adult Jesus experienced times of incredible loneliness. <em>“He was hated and rejected; his life was filled with sorrow and terrible suffering.”</em> (Isaiah 53:3 CEV) </p></blockquote><p>For instance, Jesus spent 40 days isolated in the desert battling Satan’s temptations. Constantly throughout his ministry he was misunderstood and rejected. He was lonely and disappointed with the company of close friends in Gethsemane. And of course, his solitary experience at Calvary as well as being forsaken by his Father were devasting moments of extreme loneliness in Jesus’ life. (Matthew 27:46)</p><p>Because Jesus Christ was <em>“born in the likeness of men”</em> and is God, he can both empathize and guide you out of loneliness. (Philippians 2:7) </p><blockquote><p><em>“For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.”</em> (Hebrews 4:15) </p></blockquote><p>Charles Spurgeon made this beautiful point, ""Christ leads me through no darker rooms than he went through before.""</p><p>It is not God's desire for you to feel lonely. Withdrawing, isolating, and loneliness are symptoms of disunity, which is not God's will for a member of the body of Christ (see Romans 12:4, Ephesians 2:19). </p><h1>He has formed you to be in relationship with Himself and connected to others. </h1><p>Because of Jesus Christ’s redemption, all forms of suffering, including loneliness, are passing away for those who trust in him. Confidently <em>“draw near to the throne of grace, that [you] may receive mercy and find grace to help”</em> when you feel lonely. (Hebrews 4:16) Pray that God will reveal your next step in strengthening relationships. God has people for you and people who need you!</p><blockquote><p><em>""The friendship of the LORD is for those who fear him, and he makes known to them his covenant.""</em> (Psalm 25:14) </p></blockquote><p>Your Savior understands and has promised his companionship. His Presence is right there with you and His Spirit indwells you. May Lord Jesus continue to reveal his friendship to you as you befriend him.</p><h3>Prayer:</h3><p>Heavenly Father, please turn to me and be gracious when I am lonely and afflicted. Lord, I believe You are near to me and save the crushed in spirit. I ask for guidance out of loneliness. Please reveal Your Presence to me. It is in Christ Jesus’ name that I pray. Amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1680180771199-8ZP1DU5ETBPXUAKZ2K5J/INYIM_square.jpg,442

In these <br/>passages, Jesus is waking us up. </p><blockquote><p><em>""It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his servants in charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to stay awake."" (Mark 13:34)</em> </p></blockquote><p><strong>Jesus tells us to be on guard, awake and ready for his return while fulfilling our God-given responsibilities.</strong> Christian, you have been chosen to work with God to rescue and bless souls.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I wonder if I am doing enough to serve God - until I remember Jesus. Mary said <br/>this wonderful thing to the servants at the wedding in Cana: <em>""Do whatever he tells you.""</em> (John <br/>2:5) That's it. <br/><br/>Are you doing whatever Jesus has told you? That inkling to serve, the unction to help, the <br/>direction that aligns with scripture, those may be promptings from the Holy Spirit; a sign that <br/>you are spiritually sensitive and obedient. When you get your hands on the net, whether that <br/>looks like inviting someone to church or preaching a sermon, you serve Jesus by serving others <br/>(Philippians 2:5-11). </p><h3>Here are suggestions to awaken you to His light if you are feeling spiritually groggy:</h3><p>1. <strong>Confess Sin.</strong> Come into agreement that Christ is the Lord leading your life and you are not. <br/>Receive His forgiveness and ask the Holy Spirit to point out serving opportunities prepared for <br/>you. <em>""So if anyone purifies himself from anything dishonorable, he will be a special instrument, <br/>set apart, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.""</em> (2 Timothy 2:21)<br/><br/>2. <strong>Pray &amp; Read God's Word.</strong> In doing so, your eyes will be opened to how Jesus lived. You will <br/>see the correlation between Scripture and everyday experiences. The more time you spend with your friend Jesus, the more you will become like him. <em>""Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.""</em> (Psalm 119:105)<br/><br/>3. <strong>Do Something.</strong> Whether it is doing the next right thing or agreeing to serve in a capacity <br/>beyond your current comfort level, this is where God's grace is on display in your life. <em>“My <br/>grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.”</em> (2 Corinthians 12:9) <br/>The beauty of a wakeup call is knowing something rewarding awaits you. <em>""Whatever you do, <br/>work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the <br/>inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ.""</em> (Colossians 3:23-24) One unknown day you will see Jesus Christ face to face, but while you are here do whatever he tells <br/>you.</p><h3>PRAYER</h3><p>Heavenly Father, thank You for the promise of eternity with You. Please help me to faithfully <br/>complete the work You have prepared for me. Awaken me to Your will. In the powerful name of<br/>Jesus Christ, I pray. Amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1680207516978-XQJQU1U3SAYJJRBPYQ5Q/PW_square.jpg,444

REACH Serve Day is an opportunity for us to put this calling into action by serving our local community and sharing the love of God in practical ways. Here are a few reasons why you should get involved in REACH Serve Day:</p><h2>We are called to love our neighbors.</h2><p>In Mark 12:31, Jesus commands us to ""love your neighbor as yourself."" This means that we are called to show love and kindness to those around us, regardless of their background or circumstances. REACH Serve Day provides a tangible way to love our neighbors by meeting practical needs and building relationships with those we serve.</p><h2>Serving others is a way to show our faith.</h2><p>James 2:14-17 reminds us that faith without action is dead. When we serve others, we are demonstrating our faith in a tangible way, showing others the love of Christ through our actions. REACH Serve Day is an opportunity to put our faith into action and make a difference in the lives of those around us.</p><h2>We are called to be the hands and feet of Jesus.</h2><p>In John 13:15, Jesus tells his disciples, ""I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you."" Jesus spent his time on earth serving others, healing the sick, and sharing the good news of salvation. As his followers, we are called to do the same. REACH Serve Day is a chance to be the hands and feet of Jesus by serving our community and sharing his love with those around us.</p><h2>Serving others brings joy.</h2><p>Proverbs 11:25 tells us that ""a generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed."" When we serve others, we not only bring joy to those we serve but also experience joy ourselves. There is something incredibly fulfilling about making a positive impact in the lives of those around us. REACH Serve Day is an opportunity to experience this joy firsthand.</p><p>Jesus’s first disciples were fishermen casting a net. In Matthew 4:19, “Jesus called out to them, “Come, follow me, and I will show you how to fish for people!” Jesus calls YOU to do the same. </p><h2>Get Your Hands on The Net and join us for our REACH Serve Day! </h2>

<p>Dedicating a child to growing up in a community of Christian believers is an important milestone for parents who want to raise their children with a strong foundation of faith. </p><h2>Child dedication is a public declaration of a parent's commitment to raising their child in the love and knowledge of Jesus Christ, with the support and guidance of a community of believers.</h2><p>In the Bible, we see many examples of parents bringing their children to Jesus for blessing and prayer, such as when Jesus said,</p><blockquote><p>""Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these"" (Matthew 19:14).</p></blockquote><p>Similarly, child dedication is a way for parents to present their child before God and ask for His blessing and guidance as they navigate the joys and challenges of parenting.</p><p>In addition to seeking God's blessing, child dedication also serves as an opportunity for parents to publicly commit to raising their child in a community of believers. This is important because we are not meant to walk through life alone. The journey of faith is best navigated in the company of others who share our values and beliefs. When parents dedicate their children to growing in a community of Christian believers, they are committing to actively seek out and participate in a community of faith where their children can learn, grow, and thrive.</p><h2>Furthermore, dedicating a child to growing up in a community of Christian believers can have a profound impact on the child's spiritual development. </h2><p>When a child grows up surrounded by people who love and follow Jesus, they are more likely to develop a strong faith of their own.

451,A Living Savior,post,2023-04-12 18:09:21,,/blogfeed/2023/4/12/a-living-savior,<p>A Blog by Kristin Fields</p>,"<p>The second earthquake in three days shook the Judean landscape and <em>""an angel of the Lord came down from heaven, rolled aside the stone, and sat on it."" (Matthew 28:2)</em> So much for a stone, a seal, and soldiers controlling the Son of God. Jesus was not there! The angel rolled the stone away to invite the terrified women into the tomb to see for themselves. </p><blockquote><p>""He isn’t here! He is risen from the dead, just as he said would happen. Come, see where his body was lying. And now, go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and he is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there. Remember what I have told you.” (Matt. 28:6-7) </p></blockquote><p>Jesus lives. Through scripture we are invited to observe the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. We are drawn to see for ourselves that Jesus fulfilled scripture as the Messiah and inspect the evidence that he lives.<br/><br/>The eyewitness testimony itself is stunning. Jesus first appeared to the women, then Peter, next to his disciples over a period of 40 days, and to more than 500 people at one time (1 Corinthians 15:5-6; Acts 1:3). Scripture says, <em>""but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name."" (John 20:31)</em> <br/><br/>We have been invited ‘in’ to see for ourselves.</p>

<blockquote><p>“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."" (John 3:16) <br/><br/>""For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."" (Romans 6:23)<br/><br/>""But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God..."" (John 1:12)</p></blockquote>

<p>There is no stone that can keep God's love from you. There is no authority that can keep His grace from you. There is no presence that can keep His Spirit from filling you. <em>""Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away, and see, the new has come!"" (2 Corinthians 5:17)</em> As you believe in your living Savior, may every dead thing in you pass away, and may the Lord resurrect your life in him.</p><h3>Prayer:</h3><p>Heavenly Father, thank you for the resurrection of Jesus! Thank you for my salvation through faith in Him. I pray for your resurrection power to remove anything that holds me back from experiencing newness of life in my Savior Christ Jesus.

453,Impossible Situations,post,2023-04-27 15:09:52,,/blogfeed/2023/4/27/impossible-situations,<p>A blog by Kristin Fields</p>,"<p>The fury of an impossible situation can feel like a death sentence. The truth is- your problem is not greater than Jesus Christ. Your challenges do not surprise the sovereign God who says, <em>""Call on me in the day of trouble; I will rescue you, and you will honor me.” </em>(Psalm 50:15) </p><p>God’s rescue is exactly what a captive teenager experienced under the irrational demand of a violent king. Only God <em>""whose dwelling is not with mortals"" </em>(Daniel 2:11) could know what the king dreamed and what it implied. However, Daniel knew the living God. His perspective was not on the threat of death, but the sovereignty of God.</p><p>""The king replied to the Chaldeans, <em>“My word is final: If you don’t tell me the dream and its interpretation, you will be torn limb from limb, and your houses will be made a garbage dump."" </em>(Dan. 2:5)  Without God’s intervention, Daniel was doomed as an associate of the king’s prestigious men. However, along with Kingdom perspective Daniel had allies. He <em>""urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon."" </em>(Dan. 2:18)</p><p>Prayer is not only important, it is essential. Daniel knew he was powerless to save himself. He fervently asked God for mercy, not only for his own life, but for the lives of his friends and community. The stakes were high, so Daniel bowed low knowing God gives wisdom, knowledge, and understanding. Then incredibly, Daniel rested. <em>""During the night, the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven..."" </em>(Dan. 2:19) </p><p>I imagine Daniel's praise spilled everywhere he went that day (see Dan. 2:19-23). With enthusiasm, he explained honestly to the king that <em>""there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries."" </em>(Dan. 2:28a) Daniel celebrated the greatness of God and the only Kingdom that will endure forever.</p><p>God honored Daniel for his faithfulness. The same is true for you as you seek God's will and obey Him. Not even an impossible situation can thwart God’s plan and purpose for your life. Continue to call on your Heavenly Father and praise Him for how He will reveal His greatness.</p><h3>Prayer:</h3><p>Lord God, You are greater than my problems and have perfect understanding. I ask for Your wisdom and help. May you receive all praise and glory. Thank You, Lord Jesus. Amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1682607997019-FDEKQLNV6RQP8WBYXO06/Daniel_A_square.jpg,454
455,Pride,post,2023-05-16 20:04:08,,/blogfeed/2023/5/16/pride,<p>A Blog by Kristin Fields</p>,"<p>What an incredible example we have in Daniel who understood that exercising faith in God eradicates fear, gives power, and a sound mind (see 2 Timothy 1:7). For a second time, King Nebuchadnezzar summoned Daniel to interpret another disturbing dream. The arrogant king needed a faithful person to speak truth to him.</p><p>King Nebuchadnezzar was flourishing at the epitome of his reign believing he was the source of his success. In His mercy, God warned the king through a nightmare of impending judgement. </p><blockquote><p>""This is so that the living will know that the Most High is ruler over human kingdoms. He gives them to anyone he wants and sets the lowliest of people over them."" (Dan. 4:17)</p></blockquote><p>Daniel likely felt concern as well as conviction to share the truth with this incredibly prideful man. <em>""Everyone with a proud heart is detestable to the Lord; be assured, he will not go unpunished.""</em>  (Proverbs 16:5) As disciples of Christ we too are to <em>""speak the truth in love.""</em> (Ephesians 4:15) Like Daniel, our compassion and conviction are meant to work together. </p><p>Sadly, pride is the great sin that infects not only kings, but you and me. We are quick to despise pride in others, yet it is much harder to pinpoint in our own hearts. When we consider ourselves to be the plumb line of what is admirable and give credit to ourselves, we push truth aside and agree with the lie that made Satan God’s enemy.</p><p>Commentator Bryan Chapell wrote, <em>""Talent, brains, and opportunity mean nothing apart from God's provision.""</em>  We are wise to remember what God supplies and even allows us to become is a gift of pure grace. </p><p>By this grace, the king acknowledged God and stopped quite literally living like a donkey (Dan. 4:32-33). <em>""But at the end of those days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to heaven, and my sanity returned to me. Then I praised the Most High and honored and glorified him who lives forever..."" (Dan. 4:34)</em></p><p><em>""Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, exalt, and glorify the King of the heavens, because all his works are true and his ways are just. He is able to humble those who walk in pride."" (Dan. 4:37)</em> </p><p>The moment the disturbed king worshipped the Most High, God restored him to being a man created in His image. Nebuchadnezzar proclaimed the universal, timeless truths that (1) <em>""all his works are true,""</em> (2) <em>""his ways are just,""</em> and (3) <em>""He is able to humble those who walk in pride."" (Dan. 4:37)</em></p><p><em>""Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.""</em> (Hebrews 13:8) King Nebuchadnezzar is the antithesis of Christ our King. Jesus is sinless, eternal God, merciful servant, humble and exalted by God (see Philippians 2:6-11). This is the faith we fan into flame. The gift which gives a sound mind to worship God and serve His Kingdom. Today lift your eyes to the Most High King who loves you, restores you, and empowers you to be a truth teller for His glory.</p><h3>Prayer:</h3><p>Heavenly Father, please help me recognize and overcome pride. You are the giver of all good gifts, my Source of strength and comfort. I look to You in humility for help. I pray this in my mighty Savior Jesus' name.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1682607997019-FDEKQLNV6RQP8WBYXO06/Daniel_A_square.jpg,456
457,Integrity,post,2023-05-24 15:27:59,,/blogfeed/2023/5/24/integrity,<p>A Blog by Kristin Fields</p>,"<p>My father worked for the U.S. Office of Special Counsel. He once investigated a case involving a government employee who blew the whistle on the U.S. Secretary of State. I remember thinking how courageous the person must have been to stand in their integrity knowing it would cost them their career. </p><p>Daniel was similar. His outward life mirrored his inward convictions. By the time we read Daniel 6, Daniel was over eighty years old and had a well-established lifestyle of praying three times a day (Daniel 6:10). </p><p>Whatever Daniel prayed during this time, I am convinced his prayer life was driven by devotion to God, not answers from God. By choosing to please God, Daniel’s devotion built integrity, which in turn created habits that opened a window to his Heavenly Father. </p><blockquote><p>“Then the other administrators and high officers began searching for some fault in the way Daniel was handling government affairs, but they couldn’t find anything to criticize or condemn. He was faithful, always responsible, and completely trustworthy.” (Dan. 6:4) </p></blockquote><p>When jealousy roared in the hearts of Daniel’s coworkers, they pandered to the ego of a powerful man. They knew the only way Daniel would fail the king would be to attack his relationship with God. </p><p>Where does Satan know you might fail the Almighty King? What is the one desire you cannot shake? The wrong your mind replays demanding justice? What need do you strive to fulfill rather than asking God? This is your lions’ den. </p><p>What you do matters. It matters because of God’s purpose for your life. Daniel honored God. He was not sinless, but when challenged he chose God. Because of the gift of the Holy Spirit, you too can stand in your integrity when facing threat and say, “I honored God and didn’t do any wrong.” (see Titus 2:11-14) </p><p><em>“Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.” </em>(1 Peter 5:8) But <em>“Look closely, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome and conquered!” </em>(Revelation 5:5) Just as Daniel was sealed in the lions’ den, Christ was sealed in the tomb. In both cases, these dens of death brought God greater glory. Daniel was delivered from death and Jesus Christ overcame it once for all. </p><p>The God that <em>“...delivers and rescues; he works signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, he who has saved Daniel from the power of the lions”</em> is your God too, my friend. (Dan. 6:27) Determine today to courageously honor Him even if it might cost you.</p><h3>Prayer:</h3><p>Heavenly Father, thank You that You rule in my life. You are my refuge and strength, an ever-present help in times of trouble. I commit myself to pleasing You. Help me keep my integrity regardless of the circumstances. In Jesus’ mighty name, I pray. Amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1682607997019-FDEKQLNV6RQP8WBYXO06/Daniel_A_square.jpg,458

The plan was to pull over and admire the waterfall, but my family was not content to simply sightsee. They wanted adventure which meant following a well-worn path to who knows where.  </p><p>As the tall pines thinned, we found ourselves in a breathtaking canyon. Ancient lava flows towered above while a peaceful river sliced through a pebbled beach. Our kids ran ahead, stuffing their pockets with handfuls of stunning rocks. My young geologists had found treasure and were loading up! </p><p>Scripture says that the Word of God is <em>""more desirable than gold — than an abundance of pure gold; and sweeter than honey dripping from a honeycomb.""</em> (Psalm 19:10) It renews your mind, empowering you to discern the will of God (Romans 12:2). It is a lamp and a light for your life’s journey (Ps. 119:105). </p><p>Your Bible is spiritual treasure revealing eternal truth about all of creation and the dynamics ruling our world. Rushing rivers dry up and ancient mountains crumble, but Jesus promised, <em>""Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.""</em> (Matthew 24:35) </p><p>By letting <em>“the word of Christ dwell in you richly”</em> (Colossians 3:16), you will know eternal truth. You will recognize it, you will think it, you will speak it. Paul wrote, <em>""Finally brothers and sisters, whatever is true...—dwell on these things.""</em> (Philippians 4:8) Jesus said, <em>“If you continue in my word, you really are my disciples. You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</em> (John 8:31-32)</p><p>Your Heavenly Father desires for you to fill more than your pockets with lovely bits of this world. He wants you to saturate your mind with what is true. You are created in His image with the ability to have thoughts reflective of His nature. In fact, He directs you to think about whatever is true, honorable, just, pure, lovely, and commendable (Phil. 4:8). </p><p>Jesus Christ also revealed that the greatest commandment is to <em>""Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.""</em> (Matthew 22:37) All your mind. You are loving God when you fill your thoughts with what is true and reliable - God's Word. </p><p>God is your Rock, and His Words are true (Ps. 119:160). His thoughts toward you <em>""outnumber the grains of sand."" (Ps. 139:18)</em> Respond in kind like an excited kid, rushing to fill your thoughts with the treasure of His Word. How much better than handfuls of rocks!</p><h3>Prayer:</h3><p>Thank You, Heavenly Father, that Your Word is available to me. Please give me a willingness and supernatural ability to fill my mind with Your truth. Help me to treasure it. Jesus Christ is the Word made flesh and it is in His name that I pray. Amen</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1686072173588-QDMFWCND0V471HVCMEI4/StoredUp_square.jpg,460

I can't!"" </p><p>I stood with my young daughter under a towering oak, in part for shade and in part to hide. With tears in her eyes, she pleaded to sit out of her soccer scrimmage. Her new teammates were older, more experienced, and worst of all had welcomed her with condescending stares. Intimidation and self-doubt were having a field day. </p><p>After much affirmation and encouragement, positive words did not move her forward. A change of belief was needed, so we took a little walk. During that time, the Holy Spirit called to mind scripture we had memorized together. While I affirmed that her feelings were real, I reminded her of what is true.</p><p>The truth is:</p><p><em>""...the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.""</em> (1 John 4:4) You are God's kid and an overcomer. <em>""So do not fear, for [God is] with you; do not be dismayed, for [He is] your God. [He] will strengthen you and help you..."" </em>(Isaiah 41:10) Do you remember how God's <em>""perfect love casts out fear?""</em> (1 John 4:18) </p><p>Scripture says, <em>""His power is made perfect in [your] weakness""</em> (2 Corinthians 12:9) and you <em>""can do all things through Christ who strengthens [you].""</em> (Philippians 4:13)</p><p>To my amazement, my girl said she knew what to do and walked right back into the game. She ended up playing an integral role and leaving the soccer field with a transformed perspective of herself and her teammates. </p><p>The Holy Spirit reminded me of truth we have memorized and used it to reorient my daughter’s thinking. Storing up God's Word (Psalm 119:11) gave the Holy Spirit words to call to my mind that empowered her.</p><p><em>""The unfolding of your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple.""</em> (Psalm 119:30) His Word is alive and active (Hebrews 4:12) and does not return void (Isaiah 55:11). There is power in memorizing scripture.</p><p>By cherishing His Word, God guides you into a way of life that is genuinely good and beautiful. You can do this! Recall what is true and enjoy the light that shines on your path as you memorize scripture.</p><p>Simple tips for memorizing scripture:</p><p>1. Pray for the desire and grace to memorize scripture.</p><p>2. Take your verse personally. Storing up God’s Word is about interacting with Him, not a religious should.</p><p>3. Tell someone. Accountability or memorizing with a friend is a huge help! </p><p>4. Start with a short verse. Choose a translation that strikes you. (<a href=""http://www.biblehub.com/"">www.BibleHub.com</a>)</p><p>5. Write the verse and carry it with you. Post it places where you will notice it throughout your day.</p><p>6. Repeat, repeat, repeat in writing and aloud. Try writing your verse, then tracing it multiple times in assorted colors. Your verse may even be put to music on YouTube. There are countless ways to rehearse your verse!</p><h3>Prayer:</h3><p>Father God, please give me life according to Your Word! Help me to fill my mind and heart with scripture.

As a handful of us entered her dilapidated home, she was praising God. In our hands we carried raw chicken, flour, and oil; a fortune for our Cuban friend who had just opened her last can of beans. </p><p>Gardenia practically glowed radiant with joy. She referred to herself as a missionary who shared the gospel with her people for decades despite oppression. This woman was the real deal, and I was enamored.</p><p>“Tell me something about God,” she urged with a reverently bowed head. Tongue tied and stunned, I opened my Bible and randomly read a verse lit up by yellow highlighter. It was not my finest moment of ministry because whatever I read, it did not fit the situation in the slightest.</p><p>Peter, one of Jesus’ closest disciples, said to a lame beggar, <em>“I don’t have any silver or gold for you. But I’ll give you what I have. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, get up and walk!”</em> (Acts 3:6) Peter and John <em>“looked at him intently”</em> (v4) and leaned in to help in the name of Jesus.</p><p>Throughout the gospels and Acts tremendous miracles occur <em>“in the name of Jesus.”</em> Disease, demons, and death are eradicated in the name of Jesus. The name of Jesus transforms lives and alters eternal destinies.</p><p>In the name of Jesus sometimes we see miraculous healings. Sometimes we experience strength in our weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9), or wisdom in our ignorance (James 1:5). Sometimes, like Gardenia, we experience provision coming through the door when we least expect it (Matthew 7:11). </p><p>You have been positioned in this time and place (Acts 17:26) to <em>“proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.”</em> (1 Peter 2:9) Just as Peter and John modeled Jesus, who was <em>“mighty in deed and word”</em> (Luke 24:19), we can too.</p><p>Do you believe in the power of the name of Jesus? Is there something you could tell others about God in the name of Jesus?</p><p>It makes me smile thinking about beautiful Gardenia shouting praise to God and dancing as we left her home. I had a small part in bringing her chicken and an awkward scripture reading, and she gave me marching orders.</p><p>Gardenia’s words, “Tell me something about God,” are at the forefront of my mind when I get to write, speak, teach, disciple - love. Remember with me that the name of Jesus has power to strengthen, sustain, and save people from their sins. There is hope in the name of Jesus. Let’s be like Jesus and tell them something about God.</p><h3>Prayer</h3><p>Heavenly Father, in the name of Jesus thank You for choosing me, making me holy, and setting me apart as your own treasure. I ask for the grace to reveal You to those around me in deed and word like my Savior. I pray to glorify You.

I was exhausted and my mind felt harassed by discouragement. Have you too experienced burdens obstructing your way forward?</p><p>Jesus was referring to bondage when He said, ""<em>Come to Me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. All of you, take up My yoke and learn from Me, because I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for yourselves. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.""  </em>(Matthew 11:28-30)</p><p>Jesus promised more than temporary relief. He promised cessation. He promised rest. </p><p>When we turn from our burdens to Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit reconciles us to the peace of God. There is freedom from what frustrates and perplexes us, because we submit to His lordship, His perfect understanding and care.  </p><p><em>""Casting the whole of your care [all your anxieties, all your worries, all your concerns, once and for all] on Him, for He cares for you affectionately and cares about you watchfully.""</em> (1 Peter 5:7) Jesus paints a picture of this spiritual truth through his illustration of taking up His yoke.</p><p>In Jesus’ time, a young, smaller ox is yoked to a mature ox to learn to walk as a team. The larger ox inevitably carries most of the weight of the yoke upon his shoulders. By submitting to the Lord's guidance, He carries the weight of your load and gently teaches you His way. </p><p>The New Testament writers tell us to <em>""learn Christ""</em> (Ephesians 4:20), <em>""have the same mindset as Christ""</em> (Philippians 2:5), and <em>""live as Jesus did""</em> (1 John 2:6). Jesus said, <em>""I have given you an example to follow. Do as I have done to you.""</em> (John 13:15) </p><p>Being yoked to Jesus Christ you are present with Him while he pulls your load with you. The great exchange of bondage for partnership also empowers you to walk alongside Him in the Spirit drawing in the Kingdom of heaven and reconciling souls to God (2 Corinthians 5:18). </p><p>Experience rest for your soul in coming to the One <em>""who knows all things""</em> (1 John 3:20) and <em>""holds all things together""</em> (Colossians 1:17).

Work is one way in which God grows these promises to fruition.</p><p>Work is any place where you add value, whether that is nurturing the souls within your family or influencing thousands of people. From a kingdom perspective, work is not about position, power, or even a paycheck. Work is an opportunity to reveal the heart and ways of your Heavenly Father.</p><p>Consider that Jesus ran His Father's business here on earth. How? He stayed close to His Father. Likewise, Christ tells us to abide in His love for apart from Him we can do nothing (John 15:1-17). </p><p>God has not called us to productivity as the world preaches. He has not asked us to create a 5-year plan or pursue something bigger or better. He has called us to abide in Christ. In this pursuit through scripture, prayer, and obedience, we create friendship with the Lord which yields true value.</p><p>You too have been assigned a role in your Heavenly Father's family business.

When we pray trusting God's character with minds full of His very words, it is as if we are speaking heaven’s language.

""<em>I bow down toward your holy temple and give thanks to your name for your steadfast love and your faithfulness, for you have exalted above all things your name and your word.""</em> (Psalm 138:2) Daniel, a man of the Word, begins his prayer with this same adoration, modeling one of the Bible’s most inspiring prayers. </p><p>Like Daniel, we understand God reveals His character by fulfilling His promises. It is a matter of when, not if God will keep His Word. Confidence in God's character did not lull Daniel to rest, rather it compelled him to earnestly pray.  </p><p>God's holiness in contrast to Daniel’s sin and the sin of his people, weighed heavily on Daniel's heart. He pleaded earnestly for God's mercy. He professed God's character and confessed wickedness. Daniel prayed for the sake of God’s name, His glory (Dan. 9:4-19).</p><p>God hears your prayers because of His great mercy and desires to shine upon you (Dan. 9:17). He feels tremendous compassion, and desires to give insight and understanding. For you are greatly loved, very precious, and of great value to God (Dan. 9:22-23). Fueled by His Word, may you pray trusting God’s character and for His glory. </p><h2>Reflection:</h2><p>1. Do I set aside time to dialogue with God about what I read in Scripture?</p><p>2.

His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will not be destroyed.” (Daniel 7:13-14)</em></p><h2>Reading:</h2><p>Daniel Chapter 7 begins like a nightmare. Terrorizing beasts rising from the sea is not exactly the stuff that inspires devotionals. But Daniel’s terrifying vision is the perfect pitch-black backdrop to display Christ’s glorious appearance.</p><p>Today God’s enemy comes to <em>“wear out the saints of the Most High.”</em> (Daniel 7:25) Although we cannot fathom this persecution before Christ’s return, you have met darkness designed to wear you out.</p><p>The spirit behind the antichrist in Daniel 7 schemes to oppose your faith and demand attention (see 2 Thessalonians 2:4). Yet, no matter how the enemy attempts to wear you down, he cannot wear down the Holy Spirit within you.</p><p><em>“God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross. And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.”</em> (Colossians 2:13-15)</p><p>All demonic powers were defeated by the cross of Christ.

This person’s mindset and situation had grown to such a degree that I no longer believed change was possible with our help.<br/><br/>Heartbroken, I surrendered to the reality that this was out of our control. We continued to pray, yet I could not shake the unction to fast and pray. The idea seemed to repeatedly float to the surface of my thoughts. <em>“Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen: to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke?”</em> (Isaiah 58:6)<br/><br/>My loved one’s freedom and inner healing were my heart’s constant cry. I knew deep in my core that the promises in the following verses of Isaiah 58 were the Lord’s intention. I yielded to God and committed to fasting and praying.<br/><br/>I chose a day of the week to fast from sundown to sundown. As I had breaks in my day, I locked myself in a room with a list of scriptures I prayed aloud specifically for my loved one – week after week, month after month. I want to make clear that others had been praying over the course of the year as well.<br/><br/>‘Breakthrough’ is too simple of a word to express what happened one gray December afternoon. I had said goodbye to my loved one, and experienced such anguish over their direction that the carpet under my knees was wet with tears. Within the hour, they unexpectedly appeared at my door after what can only be described as a move of God on their behalf. Within 24 hours, a complete shift began unfolding.<br/><br/>Much time has since passed, and my loved one is experiencing the goodness of God for themselves – freedom and inner healing. The trajectory of their life is moving in a completely different direction to God’s glory. To say the least, my thanksgiving has not ended.<br/><br/>By committing to an intentional time of fasting and praying scripture I also found personal relief. The repeated surrendering to the Lord, allowing Him to minister to me as well during those beautiful breaks with Him yielded more than I could ask or imagine.<br/><br/>As we begin this new year, I feel a renewed call to fast and pray for a multitude of situations and dreams. Perhaps you too are sensing an invitation to withdraw from the world to be with God. My prayer for you is to be renewed through fasting and praying, and to see a breakthrough flowing from His throne of grace. <em>“Then you will call, and the LORD will answer; you will cry for help, and he will say: Here am I.”</em> (Isaiah 58:9)</p><p><strong>Application:</strong></p><p>1. Do you have a repetitive thought about fasting and praying? What is it?<br/>2. Commit to that action for a period of your choosing. Ask the Lord to minister to you, and to move on behalf of the people and situations that are of concern to you.<br/><br/><strong>Prayer:</strong><br/>O LORD, in the morning You hear my voice. I look around and ahead with expectant faith. Lead me, Lord, and make Your way straight before me. I take refuge in You and rejoice. It is in Jesus’ powerful name I pray. Amen.

477,Wisdom,post,2024-01-25 19:45:22,,/blogfeed/2024/1/25/wisdom,<p>A blog by Kristin Fields</p>,"<h1>Scripture<em>:</em></h1><p><em>“Whoever claims to live in him must live as Jesus did.”</em>  (1 John 2:6)</p><h1>Reading:</h1><p>Wisdom is a relationship, not a result. Jesus walked, talked, and lived wisdom because of his relationship with his Heavenly Father. Likewise, you can walk, talk, and live wisely if you are in relationship with Jesus Christ.</p><p>As a young believer, I had an a-ha moment when a Christian friend revealed that when deciding she asks herself, “What is wise?” In other words, it is wise to first consider not what popculture or your neighbor may suggest, but what Jesus would do in your situation.</p><p>Through the gospels we see Jesus interacting with people. We read His parables, and about His perspectives and practices. We also find He consistently referred people back to God’s Word. He did this because God’s wisdom for humanity is revealed through scripture and its precepts, through Jesus <em>“the Word made flesh.”</em> (John 1:14)</p><p><em>“Oh, the depth of the riches… of the wisdom… of God!”</em> (Romans 11:33)</p><p>When we spend time in God’s company through His Word and prayer and seek godly counsel we are investing in our lives. We grow in wisdom. The fruit of wisdom is a heart fully committed to God. That is a heart God continuously shapes into Christlikeness.</p><p>It is a lifelong walk with Jesus, following in His steps. How incredible that heavenly wisdom comes from spending time with the Son of God. Be encouraged! As you grow in your relationship with Christ, who is wisdom, your ability to walk, talk, and live wisely will grow as well.</p><h2>Application:</h2><ol data-rte-list=""default""><li><p>Is your talk wiser than your walk? What would it take for your walk to line up with your talk?</p></li><li><p>Challenge yourself to reading one chapter of Proverbs a day. You will read the entire book by the end of the month.

479,Disciple Maker,post,2024-10-15 15:45:09,,/blogfeed/2024/10/15/disciple-maker,<p>A Blog by Kristin Fields</p>,"<h1>Scripture:</h1><p><em>“’Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, </em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.’”</em> (Matthew 28:19-20)</p><h1>Reading:</h1><p>God has a way for you to make disciples that fits your unique personality and daily interactions. Scripture implies your leading others to Christ is intended to be a natural extension of your relationship with Him rather than a duty.</p><p>Take, for instance, Lois and Eunice. </p><p><em>“I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also.”</em> (2 Timothy 1:5)</p><p>When Paul wrote these words from a dank prison cell, he was not referring to Timothy’s family traditions. Rather, he was recalling the example of these women. </p><p>These ladies’ day-to-day interactions and conversations communicated faith and obedience to Christ. This was the catalyst for Timothy’s sincere faith. These women were contagious disciple-makers.</p><p>When a Samaritan woman told her neighbors about her encounter with Jesus, enthusiasm was not something she worked up. Her experience became a part of who she was and naturally flowed into conversations. After interacting with this contagious woman, scripture says people were compelled to reach Jesus.</p><p><em>“’Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?’ They left the town and made their way to him.” </em>(John 4:29-30)</p><p>This flow is the joyful, natural disciple-making Jesus commands. Love God by allowing the volition of your relationship with Jesus to roll into your everyday interactions. Love others by fueling their trust in Christ. Love your life as you partner with the Holy Spirit in being a faithful disciple-maker.</p><h1>Your Turn:</h1><ol data-rte-list=""default""><li><p>Describe an interaction with someone that drew you in and piqued your interest.

481,The Pursuit of Success or the Pursuit of Contentment?,post,2024-10-21 17:17:05,,/blogfeed/2024/10/21/the-pursuit-of-success-or-the-pursuit-of-contentment,<p>A blog by Kristin Fields</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture:<br/> </strong><em>""I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances... I can do all this through him who gives me strength.""<br/> </em>—Philippians 4:11-13 (NIV)</p><p><strong>Biblical Context:<br/> </strong>Paul’s letter to the Philippians was written from a place of personal hardship—imprisonment. Yet, Paul speaks of contentment not based on his external circumstances but through his deep reliance on Christ. Paul contrasts worldly success and material wealth with the peace that comes from trusting in God's provision. His contentment was a result of knowing that his life, purpose, and well-being were in God’s hands, not dependent on his achievements or comfort.</p><p><strong>Devotional:<br/> </strong>In our culture, we often equate success with contentment. We pursue career advancement, financial security, and personal accomplishments, believing that we will finally feel at peace once we reach certain milestones. But more often than not, after achieving these goals, the sense of satisfaction is fleeting, and we find ourselves chasing the next achievement, hoping it will bring lasting fulfillment.</p><p>Success, as the world defines it, can never fully satisfy our hearts because we were made for something greater—something eternal. Paul’s secret to contentment, as he describes in Philippians 4, was not rooted in his circumstances but in Christ. He had learned that contentment comes from knowing and trusting God, no matter the situation.</p><p>But this doesn’t mean that ambition or goals are inherently wrong. God has a purpose for our lives, and He places visions and desires within our hearts. These desires often drive us to pursue meaningful work, to seek excellence, and to make a difference in the world. However, we must seek to understand how those goals fit into God’s greater kingdom purpose. </p><p><strong><em>True contentment comes when the desires God places in our hearts align with our everyday actions toward making a Kingdom impact.</em></strong></p><p>Proverbs 16:9 tells us, <em>“In their hearts humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their steps.”</em> While we may have ambitions, goals, and dreams, we must continually bring them before God, asking Him to shape and direct them according to His will. When we do this, we align ourselves with His greater plan for our lives. Our work, relationships, and personal pursuits become expressions of His Kingdom purposes rather than mere achievements for personal gain.</p><p>When our hearts and actions are aligned with God's vision, we begin to experience true contentment. This contentment is not tied to whether we achieve every goal on our list or reach a certain level of success. Instead, it is rooted in knowing that we are faithfully walking in the path God has laid out for us, contributing to His Kingdom in ways both large and small.</p><p>This alignment doesn’t necessarily mean we will always be comfortable or free from challenges. But it does mean we can have peace, knowing that our lives are part of something greater than our individual success. We are working for eternal purposes, building a legacy that extends far beyond our time on earth.</p><p>To live this way requires continual surrender. We must be willing to let go of goals that are purely self-serving and allow God to redefine success for us. As we seek Him, we will find that true contentment flows not from what we achieve but from living in step with His purposes, trusting that His plan is greater than anything we could accomplish on our own.</p><p><strong>Application:<br/> </strong>This week, take time to reflect on the goals and ambitions that drive your life. Are these desires aligned with God’s Kingdom purposes, or are they rooted in a pursuit of personal success? Bring your goals before God and ask Him to reveal how they fit into His greater plan. Seek contentment not in the achievement of these goals but in the daily process of living out God’s purpose for your life.</p><p><strong>Prayer:<br/> </strong>""Lord, thank You for the desires and visions You have placed in my heart. Help me to understand how these desires fit into Your Kingdom purpose. Align my goals with Your will, and teach me to find contentment in living out Your plan for my life. May my actions each day reflect a heart surrendered to You and committed to making an eternal impact. Amen.""</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1729445040440-1G7EVRJH1B1N8CJSLQAF/Faithful_Title.png,483

As I rub their backs and move hair away from their faces, I remind them that according to scripture they are chosen, dearly loved, rejoiced over, set apart for God’s purposes and uniquely gifted, fearfully and wonderfully made. They are precious in God’s sight and my own.</p><p>Magnifying what God says fuels our hope – my children’s and my own. Christian hope is the confident expectation that God is faithful to fulfill what He has started. Understand that hope is not ordinary. It is not happy optimism. Hope is how Jesus saw people, circumstances, and the future.</p><p>Jesus still views us through a lens of hope knowing who we are created to be in union with the Father. He is sovereign over circumstances that form us and reveal God’s glory. He foresees the future with confidence knowing God’s purposes will be fulfilled. He is <em>“the God of hope.” </em>(Romans 15:13)</p><p>If you have been redeemed by Christ, then you have hope. If you have experienced restoration after fragmenting sin, then you have hope. If your heart has been resurrected by God’s transforming work, then you have hope. Hope is God at work in your life. </p><p>The Holy Spirit imparts His hope as a glimpse of what eternity will be like in His light.</p><p>God’s Word speaks over your life just like a parent nurturing hope in a child. Focus on what God has declared and allow your soul to magnify the Lord. Hope is with you, actively preparing you for a wonderful future with Jesus.</p><p>Your Turn:</p><p>1. Where do you sense God working in your life? What makes you feel hopeful right now? </p><p>2. In prayer, agree with what God’s Word says about you. Imagine Jesus viewing you through His all-knowing lens of hope, His guidance, His promises for you. Nothing is impossible for God (Jeremiah 32:17, Job 42:2). Ask God to fuel confident expectation of His good plan for you.</p><p>Prayer:</p><p>Father, You are God, and I am not. I agree that what You say about me is eternal truth. I am dependent on You and thankful for Your constant work in my life. In our union, I pray for Your hope to overflow to me and through me. In Jesus’ mighty name, amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1733686371496-U0D4XVVVQTLXJ9N7FBRP/Advent+2024_Title.png,489
490,Peace,post,2024-12-19 18:34:36,,/blogfeed/2024/12/19/peace,<p>A Blog by Kristin Fields</p>,"<h2>Scripture:</h2><p><em>“For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.” </em>(Isaiah 9:6)</p><h2>Reading:</h2><p>There is no denying a river. Standing next to a mighty river like the Yellowstone or the lesser known Rivanna River near my home, I could never change their courses. However, whether a man made damn or a beaver’s, a blockage could change how I experience the river. </p><p>The same is true for the spiritual blessings that flow from God to His children. Gifts like hope, joy, and peace are continually available for Christ’s followers, but there can be blessing blockers. Their names are unending but typically they share the middle name “unbelief” and end with the surname “sin.”</p><p>Every name of Jesus eradicates these blessing blockers. <em>“Prince of Peace”</em> names the wellspring of our souls, the Source of our well-being and welfare. The regal title assures us that Jesus has the authority and power to care for and protect the citizens of His Kingdom (Philippians 3:20). </p><p>As an adopted child of God through faith in Christ, Jesus’ peace supernaturally flows like a river to your soul (Isaiah 48:18). Constant. Powerful. Abundant. Lasting peace belongs to Jesus the Prince of Peace, and it is His alone to bestow. Because we are incapable of creating our own peace, Jesus offers us His. </p><p>The means of experiencing His peace comes by redirecting your mind to God (Isaiah 26:3). Trusting Jesus and living obediently is the conduit. “<em>If only you had paid attention to my commands, your peace would have been like a river, your righteousness like the waves of the sea.” </em>(Isaiah 48:18)<em> </em></p><p>Jesus, Prince of Peace, reveals Himself to those who obey and depend on Him. Jesus said, <em>“Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.”</em> (John 14:21) The Amplified Bible translation says, <em>“I will make Myself real to him.”</em></p><p>Immanuel, God with You, cares for you. He is the Good Shephard. Lean into the Prince of Peace. There will be no denying His flow of peace to your soul.</p><p><em>“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.” </em>(John 14:27)</p><h2>Your Turn:</h2><p>1. What might be blocking the Lord’s flow of peace to your soul? Pour out your heart before the Lord for He is your refuge from these things (Psalm 62:8).</p><p>2. After surrendering what is on your heart and mind, tell Jesus why you love Him. Allow His peace to flow to you and fill your soul.</p><h2><strong>Prayer</strong><strong>:</strong></h2><p>Heavenly Father, thank You for moving me out of darkness and into Your marvelous light. I surrender what clouds my awareness of You. I confess my unbelief and sin. In their place, I receive Your peace. In the name of the Prince of Peace, I pray. Amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1734286433578-AMQNZK3TOA8KQTY8YIDW/Advent+2024_Title.png,491

I certainly have. Feeling overcome with anger because of a misunderstanding, misinformation, or mistreatment is not easy. </p><p>Whether valid or not, unchecked anger is destructive. If left ungoverned, you can count on one thing in this broken world – more broken things, including broken relationships. </p><p>Freedom from emotional bondage such as anger is possible. God desires to bring peace where there has been sin. <em>“Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding…”</em> (Proverbs 3:5) Scripture calls us to replace our natural response of anger with forgiveness.</p><p>Forgiveness becomes a bit easier when you realize it helps you. Forgiveness frees you from the control of the one who hurt you. It welcomes the love of God to purge your mind and emotions from anger.</p><p><em>“Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.” </em>(Col. 3:13) </p><p>The Lord will deal with all injustice in His time and in His way (Proverbs 15:1). No matter your circumstance, it is never too late to release yourself from the bondage of anger.

It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>Love never ends.” </em>(1 Corinthians 13:4-8)</p><h1>Reading:</h1><p>“Don’t talk about my friend that way.” </p><p>I was shocked. It took me a moment to realize my coffee companion was referring to what I was saying about myself. We do that at times, don’t we? With impatience, we speak unkindly and with resentment about ourselves. We forget to love ourselves like God.</p><p>How does God love us? He consistently and constantly loves like a champion father. Consider when a toddler is learning to walk or a child is learning to ride a bike, what does a great father do? He loves. He is patient and kind, not rude or irritable. He rejoices with the child’s attempt, protecting, believing, and hoping for what is to come. And he does not quit.</p><p>That is love.</p><p>That is the difference between human love and God’s love. We cannot love ourselves or our neighbors like God – consistently and constantly – without His Holy Spirit. </p><p>Everyone’s personal history has failed attempts to love well because we tend to rely on our own nature. Our own nature is far from holy, and if we follow our flesh, it will lead us through life with a limp. </p><p>That is why Christ gave you the Holy Spirit as your Helper when you placed your trust in Him as Savior. He also gave us a new commandment.</p><p><strong><em>“</em></strong><em>A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.”</em> (John 13:34)</p><p>How has Jesus loved you? Consistently and constantly. Patiently and kindly. He is not arrogant or rude. He does not even insist on His own way in your life. He rejoices over you because you have received Him as Lord. He covers you with Himself, believes, hopes, and endures with you.</p><p>When you tell your mind the truth about God’s love for you, it transforms your heart to genuinely love God, yourself, and others. This <em>“faith working through love” </em>is how we come to <em>“love your neighbor as yourself.”</em> (Galatians 5:6; 13-14) Receiving God’s love for you and expressing that to others is truly what matters. </p><h1>Application:</h1><ol data-rte-list=""default""><li><p>The first word God, who is love, uses to describe Himself is <em>patient</em>, then <em>kind</em>. (1 Cor. 13:4) How has God been patient and kind toward you?

Instead, share with God what is bothering you. Ask to see it in the light of His loving character and conduct.</p></li></ol><h1>Prayer:</h1><p>Heavenly Father, thank You for loving me.

Sometimes it benefits us, other times not so much. It is inspired by fear, and fear is a lousy guide.</p><p>I bet the apostle Peter’s mother would have described her impulsive boy as anything but fearful. Think about how he responded to Jesus throughout the gospels. When Jesus called, Peter immediately followed. When Jesus called, Peter walked on water. When Jesus called, Peter proclaimed, <em>“You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.” </em>(Matt. 16:16)</p><p>Yet at the end of Jesus’ ministry, when fear called, Peter denied knowing Jesus. Instead of being confident and courageous, Peter succumbed to self-preservation. “<em>He denied it again, with an oath: ‘I don’t know the man!’” </em>(Matt. 26:71-72)</p><p>Remember, this is the disciple who led the way in declaring he would die with Jesus. <em>“Peter said to him, ‘Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you!” And all the disciples said the same.’” </em>(Matt. 26:35)</p><p>Like Peter, we have all turned away from God at some point. But do you know who did not turn away and choose self-preservation in the face of fear? Jesus, the Son of God, who could have called upon thousands of angels to rescue Him (Matt. 26:53). He chose to not save Himself, but rather submitted to death to save you.</p><p>When fear draws you away from being a friend of Jesus, suggesting you had better save yourself, what should you do? What is a better way to respond when your own dreams are crucified?</p><p>Look up from your day to see it is Jesus who cares for you in the middle of the madness. Like Peter He is looking at you, knows every detail, and loves you, calling you by name. Praise God for moments that reveal you cannot save yourself.

Please don’t call on me. Please don’t call on me.”</p><p>Have you ever sat in a classroom or meeting hoping not to be called on?

And if someone asks about your hope as a believer, always be ready to explain it.”</em> (1 Peter 3:15)</p><p>Whatever the setting, if you trust Christ and serve God, people will ask about your hope. It may sound more like an observation such as, “I don’t know how you do it,” or, “You’re so peaceful.” However someone notices the Spirit in your life, consider it a divine appointment to give a gentle answer.</p><p>Remember, Jesus came to seek and to save the lost; to reconcile people to God the Father. You have been given the same mission, and there is no greater love than to lay down your life for your friends. Sharing your faith is about loving God and loving people.</p><p>It is encouraging to remember that when we share our faith, the rest is God’s work. We are not to judge or save, just simply to witness. And talking about what you have experienced or what you know of Jesus is a natural expression of spending time with Him.</p><p>Jesus said, <em>“I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.”</em> (John 15:5) </p><p>Living with Christ as Lord of your life, you are equipped to move someone a little closer to God.

I still love our pledge, our flag, our country, and as a maturing Chistian, I also understand my first allegiance is to a king and a kingdom – that is Jesus Christ.</p><p>Before Caesars and kings and presidents, there was God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit. <em>“’I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.’”</em> (Revelation 1:8)</p><p> As Christ-followers, God draws us into a devoted love with the King of kings and Lord of lords. Sometimes, however, we are swept off our feet by a lesser god, one that can steal peace, kill relationships, and destroy unity. The temptation is to invest our hope and faith in anything or anyone other than God.</p><p> Aligning yourself with King Jesus is more valuable than the promise a candidate might offer or the confidence an elected official may inspire. This election year when flags and fists are flying, view through the eyes of King Jesus and remember His pledge to the world of his future kingdom. Participate in the privilege of democracy with the security that comes from <em>“the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.”</em>(Philippians 3:8)</p><h1>Your Turn:</h1><p>1.

Jesus was a wedding guest dancing and eating, enjoying life, and welcomed!

It was most definitely an embarrassing situation for the families and could have also resulted in a costly fine. </p><p>Mary came to Jesus, not begging or bossing, but confident that He was able to help. She had faith that He knew best and would do what was right. As a result, Jesus transformed water into a superior wine revealing His transformative power.

Jesus’ friends knew what He had done. What a drastic shift from faith to seeing, from follower to friend, from working to assisting God in a miracle. This change and renewal is the Lord’s will for all who believe.</p><p><em>“I do not call you servants anymore, because a servant doesn’t know what his master is doing. I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything I have heard from my Father.”</em> (John 15:15) </p><p>What a picture of faith and obedience being rewarded!

Let the one who desires take the water of life freely.”</em> (Revelation 22:17)</p><h2><strong>Reading</strong><strong>:</strong></h2><p>In the 100 degree heat, my daughter was headed to soccer practice with what felt like a miniature bottle of water. Worried about her, I did what every good mother does. I fussed.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Mom. There’s a refill station.” </p><p>Assured that she would not faint from thirst, I sent her off with that little bottle. How simple it was for her to believe that if she came to the provided source, she would have an unending supply. This is also true for those who believe and come to Christ for His Living Water, His Spirit.</p><p>Thirsting throughout the Bible is a picture of our need to be in relationship with God. He placed eternity - a spiritual craving - in every person’s heart so that we would seek to know Him (Ecclesiastes 3:11). God has also promised to quench this thirst if we come to Him (Isaiah 12:2-3; 44:3).</p><p>In John 7:37-39 we find Jesus at the Temple on the greatest day of the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles. On this day the priest would pour water on the altar calling to mind when God provided water in the desert (Exodus 17). This tradition represented the spiritual thirst for the fulfillment of God’s promise to pour out His Holy Spirit (Isaiah 12:1-3).</p><p><em>“On the last and most important day of the festival, Jesus stood up and cried out, ‘If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink. The one who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, will have streams of living water flow from deep within him.’”</em> (John 7:37-38) </p><p>Jesus told the crowds early in his ministry those who hunger and thirst for righteousness will be filled (Matthew 5:6). He told the woman at the well that the spiritual water He has for those who come to Him and believe <em>“…will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.”</em> (John 4:14) Jesus guides all who come to Him and believe in Him to the waters of life (Revelation 7:17).</p><p>Do you hunger and thirst? Jesus continues to speak ‘come to me,’ not just ‘believe in me.’ In your mind and with your heart, come to Jesus again. Welcome His Presence.

My dad yelling, “Coming about,” and being walloped by the metal arm of a swinging sail. Sometimes hard things simply come about due to no fault of our own.</p><p>Like the blind beggar in John 9 you may have been born with an exceptional challenge or perhaps one has come about. Sin is often at the root of our challenges, but in this man’s case, Jesus made it clear that his blindness was divinely purposed (John 9:3).</p><p><em>“After he said these things he spit on the ground, made some mud from the saliva, and spread the mud on his eyes. ‘Go,’ he told him, ‘wash in the pool of Siloam’ (which means “Sent”). So he left, washed, and came back seeing.”</em> (John 9:6-7)</p><p>Nothing is above Christ’s purpose and ability to transform. Spit and mud became a healing balm. Darkness became light. A blind beggar became an eternal witness encouraging spiritual sight for endless generations.</p><p>Christ desires to reveal Himself in our trials as well (Psalm 22:30). Yet without welcoming Jesus into our darkness, we are refusing what God wants to provide. We may think we see Him, but the reality is we are still spiritually blind.</p><p>In the case of this beggar, it was the religious leaders who opposed Jesus’ work. Infuriated, they threw out the man who without wavering magnified Jesus as the Savior.</p><p>This side of eternity pain will come about, but then again so does Jesus to all who welcome Him. </p><p><strong><em>“</em></strong><em>Jesus heard that they had thrown the man out, and when he found him, he asked, ‘Do you believe in the Son of Man?’”</em> (John 9:35) </p><p>Do you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ?

Although Paul is speaking to a body of believers in Philippians 2:12, he is expecting each person to prioritize their relationship with God.  </p><p>Paul writes in the very next verse, <em>“For it is God who is working in you both to will and to work according to his good purpose.”</em> (Philippians 2:13) Growing more sensitive to Christ in us to the point of obedience is the purpose of discipleship. It is why God is at work in you. </p><p>Trusting Christ for the gift of salvation is a glorious miracle, yet being a disciple of Jesus is another miraculous feat altogether, because it depends upon our participation. Discipleship is a lifelong experience with the empowerment and company of God to love and obey like Jesus.</p><p>Christians do not work or earn salvation, but we intentionally choose to grow in our love, knowledge, and submission to God’s leadership <em>“walking in newness of life.” </em>(Romans 6:3-4) But Jesus encouraged his followers to count the cost of doing so (Luke 14:28).</p><p><em>“Then he said to them all, “If anyone wants to follow after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life because of me will save it.” </em>(Luke 9:23-24)</p><p>Paul’s exhorts the Philippians <em>“who have always obeyed”</em> to <em>“work out your own salvation.”</em> He<em> </em>stresses their submitting to the Holy Spirit’s presence and authority within them. In doing likewise we too are empowered to live obediently in the light of our new identity, attentive to Christ’s guidance.</p><p>Are you daily prioritizing and following Christ?

As we sat side by side, it was a delight to hear my name attached to her joy.</p><p>Perhaps my full heart is a glimpse into how our Heavenly Father responds to our praise. Certainly, it is not a one-sided exchange. I imagine the Lord experiences something like you and I do when a loved one genuinely praises us. We are created in His image after all. </p><p>When we are praised, it captures our attention, and our affection and joy swell. How much more so for God? And He is with us. As we give Him praise, it is as though His love and joy overflow into our souls.</p><p>The language of the King James Version reveals a beautiful insight about praising God<em>. “But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.”</em> (Psalm 22:3) </p><p>God dwells in the praises of His children. It reminds me of sitting in that space side by side with my daughter enjoying her company as she expressed gratitude and praise.</p><p>As praise fills the air, the Lord, who is love, leans in. In fact, He says He surrounds you with His faithful love. I imagine praise to be something like spiritual CPR, breathing in and out love.</p><p><em>“…the one who trusts in the Lord will have faithful love surrounding him. Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, you righteous ones; shout for joy, all you upright in heart.”</em> (Psalm 32:10-11) </p><p>That bit of praise from my daughter ended with renewed connection and remembrance of how special we are to one another.

526,Prayer is Partnership,post,2025-01-09 17:31:42,,/blogfeed/2025/1/9/prayer-is-partnership,<p>A blog by Kristin Fields</p>,"<h1>Scripture:</h1><p><em>“Because of Christ and our faith in him, we can now come boldly and confidently into God’s presence.”</em> (Ephesians 3:12)</p><h1>Reading:</h1><p>Prayer is God’s idea. Truly, it is a brilliant gift that through Christ we have direct access to God through the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 2:18). </p><p>Certainly, life will continue to move along if we do not pray, but we will miss much of the spiritual treasure and relationship Christ has given us. How often do we hear, <em>“You do not have, because you do not ask.” </em>(James 4:2)</p><p>We have the promises of God’s good gifts in our lives – His peace, provision, and protection to name a few. </p><p><em>“Who among you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him.”</em> (Matthew 7:9-11) </p><p>God is inviting you into partnership. Be His co-worker in prayer by bringing the details of your life into His shadow for safekeeping. Intercede on behalf of others. Come to Him with a willingness to be led by His Spirit. Pray for the impossible!</p><p>Through Christ you have direct access to God. Pray boldly and confidently knowing that <em>“all things are possible with God.”</em>  (Matthew 19:26) In partnering with God through prayer the Lord will do more in you, for you, and through you than you could ever imagine.</p><h1>Your Turn:</h1><p>1.

528,Bold Faith,post,2025-10-24 22:27:43,,/blogfeed/2025/10/24/bold-faith,<p>A Blog by Kristin Fields</p>,"<h2>Scripture:</h2><p><em>“Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated, common men, they were astonished. And they recognized that they had been with Jesus.”</em> (Acts 4:13)</p><h2>Reading:</h2><p>Peter and John were fishermen. Imagine them as little boys, knee-high to their fathers, pretending to tie knots onto fishing lines. Or as skinny preteens, all knees and elbows, struggling to keep their balance while heaving heavy nets overboard. Fishing on the Sea of Galilee was a part of their daily lives and became second nature to them.</p><p>But God gives His children something better than a second nature. He gives all who place their lives in His hands a new nature (Ephesians 4:24, 2 Corinthians 5:17). When we are born again, Christ begins shaping us little by little as we grow and learn at His side.</p><p><em>“While walking by the Sea of Galilee, [Jesus] saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. And he said to them, ‘Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.’ Immediately they left their nets and followed him. And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them. Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.”</em> (Matthew 4:18-22)</p><p>Peter and John knew the rhythm of casting and pulling, trusting the weight of the net and the lead sinkers to do their work. But Jesus called them away from the ordinary. He invited them to a new way of life; to fish for people, drawing others into the reality of God's kingdom.</p><p>That same invitation is ours. Not just to follow His teachings, but to accompany Jesus, letting His Spirit guide us. God's heart is for every one of His children to grasp the message and activity of God’s Kingdom. </p><p>Like Peter and John, the only way to overcome timidity and to experience freedom from the ordinary is to be with Jesus. As you spend time with Christ in His Word and prayer, trust the Holy Spirit to teach you what to do and give you the boldness to do it - as if it were second nature. God delights in granting common people uncommon boldness to His glory. </p><p><em>“Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”</em> (1 Corinthians 1:26-31)</p><h2>Your Turn:</h2><p>1. What does it mean to you that Peter and John are described as “ordinary men” in Acts 4:13? How does that encourage you in your own walk with Jesus?</p><p>2. If someone observed your life, would they be able to tell that you have been with Jesus? What might that look like in your words, actions, or attitude?</p><h2>Prayer:</h2><p>Heavenly Father, I am so grateful to be Your child through faith in Jesus Christ. Please call me out of the ordinary and grace me with uncommon boldness to envelop people in the reality of Your Kingdom. Amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1760970821845-U5H31A1F0WOAH9QQ3F58/Take+Heart+1920x920.png,529

Perhaps unjust circumstances? </p><p>In 2 Kings 4:1-7, we meet a widow who knew that kind of desperation. Her husband had died leaving her with debt she could not repay. This woman was facing poverty and likely the loss of her two sons as payment to a creditor.</p><p>This harsh reality was the result of a broken society. The kings had failed their sacred responsibilities, and the people were far from God. Moral callousness and destructive practices were the norm.</p><p>But even in a corrupt society, God saw the widow. He sent His servant Elisha to intervene. And with the kind of energy desperation creates, she cried to Elisha for help. </p><p>Elisha was a spiritual leader who had concern for individuals and ministered to families (1 Kings 17:8-24). Yet, He did not pay her debts. He also did not shame her for her need. Rather, he pointed out what she did have.</p><p>Elisha directed her to privately take steps of faith with what she had in her home - a common jar of oil.</p><p>As the woman obeyed in faith, she gathered as many empty vessels as she could find. Then, behind closed doors she began to pour. To the family’s amazement the jar poured out continually, filling every empty vessel they made available.</p><p>What a picture of God’s heart toward His people!</p><p>Like the widow’s empty vessels, our <em>“jars of clay”</em> were made to be filled with God’s oil (2 Corinthians 4:7). The presence and power of His very Spirit poured into willing and open lives.</p><p>But there is a catch. God considers our capacity. We must be empty of our own self-preservation, trying to patch our cracks, maintaining a tight lid on what we think we control.</p><p>The miracle begins when our own self-sufficiency ends. </p><p>Remember, <em>“The LORD will withhold no good thing from those who do what is right.”</em> (Psalm 84:11 NLT)</p><p>The same God who filled jars in a widow’s kitchen, still fills hearts today. There is no life too empty, no situation too far gone, no injustice too heavy that He cannot redeem.

This is one of the gifts of teaching at a Christian school. Those holy interruptions where creation points straight to the Creator. </p><p>We were talking about how God designed shells for a specific purpose. As I watched little hands turn those shells over, I could not help but point out that If God is that intentional about mollusks, how much more intentional is He with people He formed in His image?</p><p>Granted, it is a big leap from shellfish to children, but it gave me the perfect moment to share one of my favorite reminders of who we are in Christ.</p><p>Paul wrote, <em>“For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.” </em>(Ephesians 2:10)</p><p>Each one of us is uniquely created to bring about God’s goodness to our generation.

Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well.”</em> (Psalm 139:14)</p><p>God has woven His purpose into your very being. And the beauty is, you may have no idea how He plans to use you. If a shell could think, it certainly could not have imagined that one day it would help reveal God’s heart to fifty children, but God knew. In the same way, we often walk into assignments unaware of how He will use our presence, our gifts, our simple obedience.

Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.” (James 4:7-8)</p><p><strong>Reading:</strong></p><p>Sin is something like spiritual trash. Unattended it attracts flies. This is also true spiritually. Our rebellion creates an opening for negative spiritual influences. In fact, James tells us that sin “brings forth death.” (James 1:15)</p><p>When we intentionally and daily place ourselves under God’s authority, we live according to His divine viewpoint rather than our own. Then, the abundant life that Jesus promises increasingly becomes our experience (John 10:10). It is life lived through a deep and meaningful relationship with God.</p><p>Before James tells his readers to “submit to God,” he points out how these Christians were living self-reliant lives. Enticed by selfish desires they were easily deceived and experiencing turmoil. To a degree, they had stopped drawing near to God, loving Jesus, obeying Him, and their lives showed it.</p><p>We must be deliberate in what we resist and what we draw near. If we do not draw near to God, we either go with the flow or resist Him, and ultimately attract darkness. We want to live under the authority of the author of life, not death.</p><p>How are we to respond when we realize we have welcomed spiritual darkness?</p><p>We must repent of pride and confess our need for God’s authority. If not we may become “stiff necked” refusing to look to God, defensive, and self-centered. From there our spiritual enemy will continue to feed our sense of entitlement and wreak havoc in our lives.</p><p>Ask the Holy Spirit to reveal if you are living outside of God’s protective authority. Make up your mind to submit daily to Him with your whole being. Place yourself under the Lord’s care through repentance and obedience.</p><p>For it is Your God who promises, “Therefore let us [with privilege] approach the throne of grace [that is, the throne of God’s gracious favor] with confidence and without fear, so that we may receive mercy [for our failures] and find [His amazing] grace to help in time of need [an appropriate blessing, coming just at the right moment].” (Hebrews 4:16AMP)</p><p><strong>Your Turn:</strong></p><p>1.

I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.” </em>(John 10:9-10) </p><h2>Reading:</h2><p>Have you ever had to explain how to use a door? It sounds strange, right? Doors are typically self-explanatory. They serve a clear and obvious purpose - leaving and entering. </p><p>There is a door that beckons all to leave more than just a space. There is a door that leads to a more profound relationship than any other. </p><p>Twice in the Gospel of John Jesus said, <em>“I am the door.”</em> (John 10:7-10) </p><p>With that simple illustration Jesus invites us into something life changing. What is it that Jesus calls every person to leave? Perhaps it is not simply a way out, but a way in. His life is the way in to living the fullest life possible, a life lived interacting with God. </p><p><em>“Come near to God and he will come near to you.” </em>(James 4:8)<strong><em> </em></strong></p><p>We all have stories of leaving and entering spaces and seasons. Maybe you have a story of leaving a life lived without God and being born again into life with Him. Have you ever considered Jesus has a personal testimony about you too? What is your story from His loving perspective? </p><p>Whatever those details may be, Jesus knows every moment that has led you to where you are. He is the One who drew you to Himself (John 6:44). He has removed your sin as far as the east is from the west and you are safe in Him (Psalm 103:12, John 10:9). </p><p>Psalm 103:2-5 paints a beautiful picture of what this looks like. <em>“Praise the Lord, my soul, and forget not all his benefits— who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion, who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.”</em> </p><p>As you walk through the doors that life presents to you, remember the door that Jesus is—the one that leads you straight into His love and an abundant life. </p><h2>Your Turn: </h2><ol data-rte-list=""default""><li><p>What has Jesus Christ brought you out of?

Favorite foods satisfy our bodies. Media satiates our souls. News stimulates our minds. The illustrations are endless. But these fillers are often a brief attempt to distract ourselves from spiritual hunger. </p><p><em>“’I am the bread of life,’ Jesus told them. ‘No one who comes to me will ever be hungry, and no one who believes in me will ever be thirsty again.’”</em> (John 6:35)</p><p>Jesus was speaking to a crowd who had seen His divine power. He had miraculously multiplied a small boy’s even smaller lunch to feed five thousand men and their families.</p><p>The crowd recognized this miracle as a sign of the Messiah, a second Moses of sorts, and hoped to make Jesus king. They were hungry for another miracle, something immediately satisfying. Yet Jesus shifted their focus to what is eternal.</p><p><em>“’Truly I tell you, anyone who believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life. Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that anyone may eat of it and not die.</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread he will live forever. The bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.’” </em>(John 6:47-51)</p><p>The living bread is not the same manna the crowd’s ancestors ate in the wilderness, but something greater! Jesus is the Messiah, the Savior of the world who gives eternal life. He gives Himself.</p><p>As eternal spiritual beings, we need His salvation as well as His spiritual nourishment. Like a branch grafted to a vine, we are to daily draw from Christ. </p><p>The bread of this world is full of fillers that in the end leave us feeling empty. Jesus is the Source and Sustainer of life. Jesus is the miracle! Bring your hungry heart to Him and be satisfied by the living bread.</p><h1>Your Turn:</h1><p>1. Do you hunger for more of Jesus? Tell Him.

The one who believes in me, even if he dies, will live. Everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?’”</em> (John 11:25-26)</p><h1>Reading:</h1><p>There is a special woman mentioned three times in the gospel accounts. At every mention of this woman, she appears at the feet of Jesus (Luke 10:39, John 11:32; 12:3). Her name is Mary of Bethany. Whether Mary is listening, grieving, or worshiping, she is always near Christ. </p><p>In John 11, Lazarus, who is Mary’s brother and a close friend of Jesus, is battling for his life. Mary sent word to Jesus, trusting that He would save her brother. He healed everyone who sought Him! But to her utter heartbreak, Jesus did not come.</p><p>Lazarus was buried in his tomb. Four days later Mary learned that Jesus had finally arrived on the scene. She came to Him, fell at His feet, and poured out her heart, affirming what she believed<em>. ""Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.""</em> (John 11:32) In her grief, she still clung to the truth - Jesus is life.</p><p>Yet, Mary and Lazarus’ story did not end with this pain. Jesus allowed their profound suffering <em>“for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”</em> (John 11:4) Just as Lazarus' story did not end in the tomb, our painful situations can also experience new life.</p><p>Christ’s resurrection power is available not only as a future hope but also a present reality. As we invite Jesus into our circumstances, trusting His transformative power, we can be near to Him in prayer and wait with His empowerment. This changes everything!</p><p>Paul reminded the believers in Rome of this powerful truth.<em> “We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may walk in newness of life.” </em>(Romans 6:4)</p><p>The same Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead now lives in you (Romans 8:11). His resurrection power is not just available - it is active. </p><p>As you consider Mary at the feet of Jesus - wondering, weeping, worshiping - may her example lead you to that same place of surrender and trust. He is the resurrection and the life. You are united to the One who conquered death and now offers His resurrection life to you. Keep coming to Jesus, again and again, where grace flows freely, and life begins anew.</p><h1>Your Turn:</h1><p>1. Like Mary, am I consistently positioning myself at the feet of Jesus regardless of my circumstances?</p><p>2. What areas of life feel broken or burdensome? Ask Jesus to bring His resurrection power into those places.</p><h1>Prayer:</h1><p>Lord Jesus, thank You that You are the resurrection and the life. There is no other like You!

547,Hearing God,post,2025-05-22 15:48:54,,/blogfeed/2025/5/22/hearing-god,<p>A blog by Kristin Fields</p>,"<h2>Scripture:</h2><p><em>“My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me</em>.” (John 10:27)</p><h2>Reading:</h2><p>Between the wailing toddler and the chatting employees folding shirts, I heard my mom. It was a bustling weekend at Costco. Shopping carts maneuvered the tight lanes between the clothing tables. At the time, I was focused on the latest activewear, while Thin Mint Bites were calling my name.</p><p>Then I heard it. “Kristin.” My mom’s voice.</p><p>I could not see where she was, but the moment I heard her, my attention shifted. I did not need to see her to know it was my mom. She was somewhere in the distance. Her voice small and indistinct to my neighbors, but unmistakable to me. Why? Because I am her child.</p><p>I followed the impression the sound of her voice made, weaving through shoppers and squeezing past the sweater table until I saw her. She was standing still, her happy eyes fixed on me.</p><p>In the same way, as God’s children, we recognize the voice of our Good Shepherd even in the middle of life’s noise. Not because it is the loudest, but because it is His voice. Concise. Kind. Personal. When we stop striving and start resting as His beloved, we begin to hear His still, small voice more clearly.</p><p>Jesus said, <em>“My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.”</em> (John 10:27)</p><p>The moment we place our trust in Jesus for salvation, something beautiful happens. We become part of His family. He knows us, and we learn to know Him by the Word of God and the Spirit of God. His voice rises above the chaos, not through volume, but through relationship.</p><p>Remember Jesus also said, <em>“Everyone the Father gives me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will never cast out.” </em>(John 6:37)</p><p>If you have come to Him by faith, you have entered into something more than belief. You have stepped into a living, loving, lasting relationship with the Son of God. And through this relationship, He has equipped you to hear His voice. Be aware of Him. He is your Good Shepherd, the One who laid down His life for you. Trust Him. Follow Him. He knows the way.</p><h2>Your Turn:</h2><p>1. What promises does Jesus make to His followers in John 10:27?</p><p>2. It takes faith to follow the voice of God. Consider this verse. How does it encourage you to persevere with faith? <em>“Since, then, we have such a hope, we act with great boldness</em>.” (2 Corinthians 3:12)</p><h2>Prayer:</h2><p>Lord Jesus, I am so grateful that You are my Good Shepherd. I want Your voice to be the most recognizable voice to me – above all others. Please give me grace to listen and follow You in increasing measure. Amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1747591423314-1U2K3M5MC75IQHD81ELL/3840x2160+John.png,548
549,A Beautiful Thing,post,2025-06-19 14:32:31,,/blogfeed/2025/6/19/above-the-threat,<p>A blog by Kristin Fields</p>,"<h1>Scripture: </h1><p><em>“Then Mary took a twelve-ounce jar of expensive perfume made from essence of nard, and she anointed Jesus’ feet with it, wiping his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance.”</em> (John 12:3 NLT)</p><h1>Reading: </h1><p>Imagine enjoying dinner, the room filled with friends, and the scent of food lingering in the air. The occasion? A meal in honor of Jesus, the One who just days before called Lazarus, who was dead and buried, back to life. The energy around the table is buzzing with gratitude, awe, and expectation.</p><p>And then silence.</p><p>Perhaps it is the scent that catches your attention or maybe the soft sound of movement nearby. You glance up from your plate and see Mary, eyes brimming with tears, as she pours an expensive, fragrant perfume over Jesus’ feet. She kneels low, and with her own long hair, gently wipes them dry. This is not a moment of hospitality. It is worship. It is surrender. And it is deeply personal. </p><p>The Lord tenderly received this moment from Mary. In fact, throughout the New Testament we see that Jesus received everything brought to Him that aligned with the heart of God. </p><p>Having encountered the love and power of Jesus, Mary gave to Jesus what cost her deeply - her treasure and reputation. </p><p>Meanwhile, the leaders who believed in Him remained silent. Their fear of rejection and hunger for approval kept them from stepping forward. </p><p><em>“Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue; for they loved human praise more than praise from God.”</em> (John 12:42-43)</p><p>Friend, is there anything keeping you from fully pouring your life out at the feet of Jesus? Approval of others? Fear of being misunderstood? </p><p>Because anything that keeps you from Him is bondage. And bondage never comes from God.</p><p>Allow your devotion to the Lord to come through. He will receive you, defend you, and honor you (John 12:7, Matthew 26:13). He may even call it beautiful.</p><p><em>“Aware of this, Jesus said to them, “Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me.”</em> (Matthew 26:10)</p><h1>Your Turn: </h1><p>1. Do you tend to hold back your devotion to Jesus because you fear being judged?</p><p>2. Will your actions today be remembered as <em>“a beautiful thing”</em> done for Jesus? Ask the Holy Spirit to reveal how you can best worship Him today.</p><h1>Prayer: </h1><p>Lord Jesus, thank You for receiving me. I confess fear and valuing people’s opinions over our relationship. Help me to love You with my entire being - heart, soul, strength, and mind. Please show me how to give my best to You today. You are worth it all. Amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1750012907031-M5BX519KSYRP5ZMSPIBE/3840x2160+John.png,550
551,Love Like Jesus,post,2025-07-02 20:06:02,,/blogfeed/2025/7/2/love-like-jesus,<p>A blog by Kristin Fields</p>,"<h1>Scripture:</h1><p><em>“A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”</em> (John 13:34–35)</p><h1>Reading:</h1><p>A simple scroll through social media reveals a lot of what we love: our families, food, puppies, and vacations. Heart emojis and “#love” are everywhere online but meet someone face to face, who is hard to love, and suddenly our virtue can be rather lacking.</p><p>But Jesus was not vague. </p><p>During one of His final conversations with the disciples before the cross, He reiterated the Old Testament command to <em>“…love your neighbor as yourself.”</em> (Leviticus 19:18) Yet the way He worded it was radical. <em>“A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you,…”</em> (John 13:34)</p><p><em>“As I have loved you,…”</em> Jesus had just washed their grungy feet. And let us not forget that Judas was still at the table when he said this. He knew Peter would deny Him within hours too. Yet, He still looked around at that broken group of men and said, <em>“By this…”</em> (John 13:35)</p><p><em>“By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”</em> (John 13:35)</p><p>He did not mean that we are to love when it is convenient, nor when people earn it. He did not command to love only the people who agree with you, live like you, or speak kindly to you.</p><p>We are to simply love one another - selfless, sacrificial, servant-hearted love - like Jesus. This is the mark of a maturing Christian.</p><p>This kind of selfless love is hard. It means forgiving when it hurts. Listening without needing to be right. Showing up with the perspective of Christ when others (or you) fall short. </p><p>Jesus said that everyone will know we are His disciples, not by our theology, our Instagram reels, or our opinions, but by how we love. That is our defining trait, the spiritual fingerprint of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>So today, maybe the most radical thing we can do is ask, “How can I love like Jesus right now?” It may look like giving someone your full attention, offering an apology, or taking the risk. </p><p>The world does not need more photographs and clever words about what we love. It needs living proof of Christ’s love in action. By this love, His love, Jesus has invited you to be that proof. </p><h1>Your Turn:</h1><p>1. In what way is Jesus’ command to love one another a new command? </p><p>2. What does a life defined by Christ-like love look like? Pray for a clear way to show love this week.</p><h1>Prayer:</h1><p>Heavenly Father, thank You for revealing true love, Your love through Jesus. Help me to die to my self-life and live to love others selflessly. Let Your love shine through me. Amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1747591423314-1U2K3M5MC75IQHD81ELL/3840x2160+John.png,552
553,Soul Rest,post,2025-07-21 14:15:14,,/blogfeed/2025/7/21/soul-rest,<p>A blog by Kristin Fields</p>,"<h2>Scripture:  </h2><p><em>“Rest in God alone, my soul, for my hope comes from him.” </em>(Psalm 62:5 CSB)</p><h2>Reading:</h2><p>I have lost count the number of times I have asked my kids to pick up their rooms. Have you been there too? We know that there is something to putting our stuff in its proper place that instantly brings peace. The same is true for thoughts that run amuck, tangling our emotions.</p><p>That is when you need to put your soul to rest, tucked safely into your Lord’s presence - its rightful place.</p><p>David reminded himself (and us), <em>“Rest in God alone, my soul, for my hope comes from him.” </em>(Psalm 62:5)</p><p>David wrote this while he and his exhausted people<em> </em>fled for their lives (see 2 Samuel 17:29). Instead of spiraling into anxiety, he chose to direct his mind and heart to rest in God, reliant on His faithful care.</p><p>Like a sword resting in its sheath, David placed his soul where it belonged. His hope was grounded on substantial evidence: the promises of scripture, the testimony of God’s people, and his own relationship with God. David knew and trusted God’s character.</p><p>You and I can do the same, even when relationships, responsibilities, and news headlines are chaotic. </p><p>God is faithful even when we are faithless (2 Timothy 2:13). That is who He is! The Lord will never abandon you nor forsake you. He is with you, and His desire is to do good for you (Jeremiah 29:11-13).</p><p>C.S. Lewis once wrote, “He who has God and everything else has no more than he who has God only.” </p><p>The Lord is breathing room for your soul. In quiet, allow God to furnish your expectations with His promises. Hope will come, and His hope will not disappoint (Romans 5:5).</p><h2>Your Turn:</h2><p>1. When your soul is anxious, picture yourself like a child climbing into the arms of Jesus. He said, <em>“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.”</em> (Matthew 11:28)</p><p>2. Take intentional time to be still before God. Turn down the noise. Meditate on a promise like 1 Peter 5:7, <em>“Cast all your cares on Him, because He cares for you.”</em> Surrender your fears, your future, and your family into His faithful hands.</p><h2>Prayer:</h2><p>Lord God, I come to You and want to rest in the assurance of Your promises, power, and presence. You are the Source of my hope. With thankfulness and expectation, I trust You. In Jesus’ name, I pray. Amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1753034125201-0TOA2ZBERTIV5U52M4ZD/Podcast+3840+x+2160+px.png,554
555,The Perfect Parent,post,2025-08-13 18:58:34,,/blogfeed/2025/8/13/the-perfect-parent,<p>A blog by Kristin Fields</p>,"<h1>Scripture:</h1><p><em>“See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are!”</em> (1 John 3:1)</p><h1>Reading:</h1><p>I can still feel the gentle rocking, the warm weight of my little girl resting in my lap; the faint scent of baby shampoo. That evening, highlighted only by the hallway light, our speech delayed daughter began to sing with me - a song, a definite message, I had sung to her from her very beginning. </p><p><em>“Jesus Loves Me.” </em>My words had become her own. </p><p>In that moment, I felt so much joy!</p><p>Lest you think I’m tooting my own horn, I also recall hearing from another child in a heated discussion something much harder. Our teenager told me that when she thinks critical thoughts about herself, it’s my voice she hears.</p><p>In that moment, my heart cracked.</p><p>There is only one perfect parent. The Bible shows that God lovingly, truthfully speaks with purpose. His words are never careless. He is our good Father who builds us up, corrects us with His love, and calls us to His will. </p><p>If it’s true that our parents’ voices significantly influence our inner voice, then it certainly would benefit us to know our perfect Heavenly Father’s voice. And as a child of God and by the power of His Spirit, we can also be His echo, speaking life-giving words to those around us, especially to our children.</p><p>Your Heavenly Father speaks over you, His child, with love and devotion. He assures you that His affection is not dependent on your performance (Zephaniah 3:17). His words guide you (Psalm 32:8). And like a present Father, He calls you back when you wander from what is best and lovingly corrects you (Proverbs 3:11–12). Your Heavenly Father’s voice always resonates with hope. </p><p>As you spend time in God’s Word, notice His voice in your thoughts: words of identity, love, delight, guidance, wisdom, instruction, encouragement, and hope. Yes, indeed Jesus loves you deeply. Choose to be His echo.</p><h1>Your Turn:</h1><p>1. In a world that uses all sorts of labels, knowing God calls you His “<em>chosen</em>” and “<em>beloved</em>,” how does that change the way you see yourself (1 Peter 2:9)? </p><p>2. How can you remind yourself that the Lord is <em>rejoicing</em> over you every day (Zph. 3:17)?</p><h1>Prayer:</h1><p>Lord God, You are so good! Thank You for speaking life over me. Please renew my mind and transform me to echo Your life-giving words, especially to my loved ones.

557,Growing,post,2025-08-28 17:29:03,,/blogfeed/2025/8/28/growing,<p>A blog by Kristin Fields</p>,"<h1>Scripture:</h1><p><em>“Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.”</em> (1 Corinthians 11:1)</p><h1>Reading:</h1><p>When I first walked into an elementary school as a brand-new teacher I was absolutely clueless. I had graduated with honors, and I knew what good teaching could produce, but I had no idea how to actually get there. Thankfully, I was placed on a team with experienced teachers who took me in and showed me how it’s done.</p><p>That’s the story you’ll hear from most impactful teachers. The most valuable lessons didn’t come through theory and knowledge, but from mentorship, modeling, and life on life experience. </p><p>This is exactly the way Jesus calls us to grow as His disciples.</p><p>Jesus said, <em>“‘All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.’” </em>(Matthew 28:18-20)</p><p>Jesus wasn’t giving his disciples a suggestion. He was giving them their mission. And it’s ours too. We are called to live under God’s authority, to follow the ways of His Kingdom, to immerse others into the reality of God, and to teach them how to do the same.</p><p>That’s a pretty heavy lift.</p><p>But here’s our hope – Jesus promised to always be with us. Through His Spirit He empowers us to live out what He has commanded. His Holy Spirit is our helper (John 16:7).</p><p>When you walk in obedience you open yourself to the flow of God’s grace. He renews your mind, restores your soul, revives your heart to bless you - and to empower you to disciple others. </p><p>Paul put it this way: <em>“He is the one we proclaim, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ.”</em> (Colossians 1:28)</p><p>This is the way of apprenticeship. Life on life. It’s how Jesus lived with His followers. And it’s how we are called to live today. It’s an invitation to bring people close, to point them to Jesus, and to grow side by side into His likeness (1 Timothy 4:8).</p><h1>Your Turn:</h1><p>1. Being a Christian is more than simply attending church. You are the church, the body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:27). How might God be inviting you build up and disciple others?</p><p>2. Who has modeled the way of Jesus for you? How can you do the same for someone else?</p><h1>Prayer:</h1><p>Lord Jesus, thank You so much that You disciple me through Your Word, Your Spirit, and Your people. Help me to go and make disciples. Teach us to obey all you have commanded for Your glory and our blessing.

559,Above the Threat,post,2025-08-06 12:51:09,,/blogfeed/2025/8/6/above-the-threat,<p>A blog by Kristin Fields</p>,"<h1>Scripture:</h1><p><em>“The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are protected.”</em> (Proverbs 18:10)</p><h1>Reading:</h1><p>The sea spray stung my face, and the sunlight was blinding as I squealed with delight. My dad had just lifted me high above a crashing wave. In that moment, he was the center of everything. He was my protector, my safety, my joy.</p><p>I did not know how my dad would do it, but I knew he would. As his daughter I trusted him – his strength, his love, his timing. I looked to him and in one smooth motion he raised me above the threat with perfect timing.</p><p>Just as my father stood like a strong tower and shielded me from a force too strong for me to withstand, God is our ever-present refuge. </p><p><em>“God is our refuge and strength, a helper who is always found in times of trouble.”</em> (Psalm 46:1)</p><p>As you seek refuge in God, centering your heart and life on Jesus, you are protected. You do this by relying upon His character and love for you even as you feel waves crashing around you. </p><p>Proverbs 18:10 says the righteous are “protected,” but in the original Hebrew, the word carries a deeper meaning. It means <em>exalted</em> – lifted up, set out of the reach of danger. It is not just about hiding; it is about being raised above the threat. </p><p>Jesus was lifted up on a cross for you. And because of Him, you are lifted up too.</p><p><em>“He also raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavens in Christ Jesus…”</em> (Ephesians 2:6)</p><p>Jesus knew the waves of torture, humiliation, and death were coming. He knew His closest friends would deceive, deny, and doubt Him. Yet, He trusted His Father. Jesus rested in His Father’s power, faithful love, and perfect timing to lift Him above His enemies. (John 13)</p><p>That same Father, your Heavenly Father, is lifting you too. Jesus has already taken the crushing wave. Now, you are secure in Him. Today may the Holy Spirit fill you with the joy of victory as you run to Him. Let your Heavenly Father lift you above fear, above uncertainty, above the threat.</p><h1>Your Turn:</h1><p>1. What feels threatening to you today? Run to the Lord in prayer. Ask Him to lift you above it to help you see from His perspective and to trust His perfect timing. (Ecclesiastes 3:1, 1 Timothy 6:15)</p><p>2. How have you seen the Lord’s character and care for you in the past? Reflect on the ways He has protected and provided for you.</p><h1>Prayer:</h1><p>Heavenly Father, thank You for lifting me above what is threatening. You are my helper, my strong tower, who is always found in times of trouble. Thank You, Jesus.

561,Jesus at the Lunch Table,post,2025-09-11 23:34:34,,/blogfeed/2025/9/11/jesus-at-the-lunch-table,<p>A blog by Kristin Fields</p>,"<h1>Scripture:</h1><p><em>“Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”</em> (Matthew 28:19-20)</p><h1>Reading:</h1><p>“My friend asked Jesus into her heart today!” </p><p>I can still see my kindergartener with her Dora backpack parachuting over her shoulders. Climbing into our minivan one hot pink Converse at a time, she announced her news.</p><p>“I told her about Jesus at lunch and asked if she wanted Jesus to live in her heart too.” </p><p>They prayed with peanut butter jelly sandwiches in their hands.</p><p>For the life of me, I will never get over this. The ease. The simplicity. The pure-hearted wonder of it all.</p><p>But here’s the thing - it didn’t happen in a vacuum. She had been discipled.</p><p>Jesus commands us to <em>“make disciples”</em> (Matthew 28:19). That word <em>cause</em> may be helpful when considering the Lord’s mandate to make disciples. The Greek word for <em>“make“ </em>carries with it the idea of helping others enter into the life of discipleship. </p><p>My daughter had not been trained to lead her friend to Christ. She was simply raised to know the love of Jesus, His Word woven through our everyday rhythm and community.</p><p>My daughter’s heart was in step with her knowledge of God.</p><p>That’s what the Holy Spirit does. Whether the ancient apostles or a modern kindergartener, as we spend time with Jesus in prayer and take in Scripture, He causes our heart knowledge to surpass our head knowledge (John 14:26, Ephesians 3:16-19). He empowers us with courage (2 Timothy 1:7), equips us with His Word (2 Timothy 3:16-17), and promises His presence always (Matthew 28:20).</p><p>Making disciples can feel overwhelming. But just as my daughter went with Jesus into her cafeteria, you too have Jesus in every ordinary place.</p><p>So, the question is how is God leading you? Who is at your table? Who are you walking beside, eating with, and listening to this week? Your obedience may cause another heart to say yes to Jesus.</p><h1>Your Turn:</h1><p>1. When have you sensed God’s love surpassing your understanding, and how can you share that testimony to encourage someone else?</p><p>2. Since Scripture equips us (2 Timothy 3:16-17), the Spirit strengthens us (Eph 3:16-19), and Jesus sends us (Matt 28:19-20), what would it look like for you to rely on all three as you live out your faith this week?</p><h1>Prayer:</h1><p>God, thank You for discipling me through Your Spirit, Your Word, Your people. Strengthen me to live and love in a way that reflects you. I pray for grace to teach others to obey all that You have commanded.

It was written by a worship leader who longed for God. His season of life felt pitch-black like midnight – a cloudy, starless midnight. There was no sign of the joy that once marked his life.</p><p>Rather than shouts of gladness and songs of praise, questions echoed through his mind, <em>“Why am I discouraged? Why is my heart so sad?”</em> (Psalm 42:5)</p><p>He vulnerably confessed the torment of a constant taunt in his thought life. <em>“Where is your God?”</em> (Psalm 42:10)</p><p>The weight of oppression and the turmoil within left him feeling forgotten, unseen, overwhelmed.</p><p>Have you ever felt that way? Like breakers and waves of sorrow crash into your soul, only to retreat and creep in again with relentless rhythm. You are not the only one. Seasons of wrestling between faith and despair occur in every believer’s life.</p><p>However, this songwriter, the author of Psalm 42, offers us a lifeline, not in the form of easy answers but in the form of remembrance.</p><p>The psalmist chooses to remember God. <em>“I will put my hope in God! I will praise him again – my Savior and my God!”</em>(Psalm 42:5 NLT)</p><p>Even when God seems hidden from your circumstances, scripture reminds us that your spirit is united to Him with Christ. <em>“But whoever is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit.”</em></p><p>And even in the night He gives songs (Job 35:10).</p><p>Zephaniah 3:17 paints a beautiful picture of God’s presence, power, pleasure, and peace – His sacred song over you even in the dark: <em>“For the LORD your God is living among you. He is a mighty savior. He will take delight in you with gladness. With his love, he will calm all your fears. He will rejoice over you with joyful songs.”</em> (Zephaniah 3:17 NLT)</p><p>God is the Source of all life, and He sustains you in the dark. Where the enemy has carved emptiness into your soul, God fills it with His comfort and assurance – His song in the dark.</p><p>So today remember God’s Presence. Remember His mercy. Remember His loving kindness. Dare to believe God is rejoicing over you.</p><p>In faith, begin to sing back. Maybe it starts with a whisper, maybe a hum. But as your soul catches up, you will again praise the One who has never stopped singing over you.</p><h1>Your Turn</h1><ol data-rte-list=""default""><li><p>Psalm 42 shows a choice to remember God which leads to praise. What steps can you take to shift your focus from despair to remembrance?</p></li><li><p>What “songs in the night” has God given you? What moments of comfort, scripture, or worship have helped you endure a dark season? How can you return that song to Him in praise?</p></li></ol><h1>Prayer</h1><p>God, I remember You and I want to return to You Your song. Thank You for Your comfort, Your faithfulness to me. It is Your great power that overcomes darkness. Thank You for the victory I have in Jesus Christ.

However, there are other people who are grieving and struggling to find joy.  The Christmas season can feel dark and lonely to many people, for many different reasons.</p><p> I think of my dear friend, Wendy, who suddenly lost her husband, Gus, in November due to a sudden heart attack.  Wendy and her 17 year old son are deeply grieving the loss of their husband and father as they experience their first Christmas without him.  Gus was a man who loved Jesus and lived to serve God by doing good deeds for others.  He was a self-employed carpenter (ironic, I know) who never turned a profit because he only charged his customers for exact amount of the materials he used and the bare minimum for his time.  He would drop everything to go help an elderly woman with her septic system, or fix a leaky faucet, or gift a single mother of 3 with a car (seriously!), or adopt a dog that you could no l longer care for.  His acts of kindness and generosity were limitless and always in the name of Jesus.  </p><p> As you might expect, Gus loved celebrating Christmas!  He exuded joy and he always wore a Santa hat during December. He would even carry extra Santa hats to give to people.  In fact, I just dug into my winter hat and glove bin the other day and there at the top of the bin were several Santa hats that Gus had given to me a few years earlier.  The memory is bittersweet, but it makes me smile.  </p><p> Isaiah 9 fills me with hope as I think about the birth of Jesus and what His life and death means for His believers.  But during this time of darkness for my friend Wendy, her son, and all the people who loved Gus, I lean into verse 2 for comfort that our Lord is with us even in times of pain and sorrow.  Our Lord and Savior is the Light of the World, a light that we can cling to for comfort.  Even when our hope is diminished, Jesus renews our hope and leads us through the darkness when we seek Him.  </p><p> Heavenly Father, Thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to live and die for us. Thank you, Jesus, for being our hope and our light when our days get dark and our burdens are heavy.  Thank you for loving us and always meeting us exactly where we are in our joys or struggles.  As we approach this holiday season, bring peace to our hearts and let us find comfort and healing in your joyous light.  And thank you, Lord, for the life of Gus.  There is no doubt in my mind that he is walking with you in Heaven wearing his Santa hat.  Maybe he even has you wearing one, too?  In your holy name, we pray.  Amen!</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1576897211832-OO5HB6NRG2Z7KP4C6JOK/7.1_SQ_Master.jpg,566
567,An Inside-Out Kind of Year,post,2019-12-31 15:00:00,,/blogfeed/an-inside-out-kind-of-year,<p>Today’s blog was written by Amber Parker.</p>,"<p>“He who has found his life will lose it and he who has lost his life for My sake will find it.” Matthew 10:39 NASB</p><p>Often, God uses a specific scripture verse to challenge me and set the tone for an upcoming season. The start of this year was no exception. I found myself reading Ecclesiastes chapter eleven over and over. Here we are reminded that if we don’t take steps of faith, we will be like a farmer who never sows any seeds but still expects a crop to spring up. </p><p>It was as if God was telling me - it’s time to move. It’s time to be bold. It’s time to make changes. </p><p>So far, so good. </p><p>Then I got to the last verse of the chapter, “Remove grief and anger from your heart and put away pain from your body, because childhood and the prime of life are fleeting.” (Ecclesiastes 11:10) Now it was as if God was shining a spotlight on my soul, showing me that if I wanted to walk by faith and make an impact in the world, I had a critical step to take - it was time to heal. </p><p>This began what I would call an inside-out kind of year. On the outside – life was fairly normal. Sure, it had highs and lows, but overall it was stable and even somewhat predictable. However, on the inside, I experienced dramatic change as I walked through a painful process of seeing the dark places of my heart. </p><p>If I’m honest, I’m not sad to say good-bye to 2019. The process of growth wasn’t easy. Many days I questioned God. <em>Why? What are you doing? When will this be over? What is the purpose of this?</em></p><p>I don’t know what kind of year you’ve had, but chances are you can relate to experiencing pain and hurt. If we are not careful, we can carry the pain of the past into our future. We can allow doubt and fear to overshadow God’s promises. </p><p>As we look to 2020, God has given me a new verse to mark a new season. Jesus promised that “he who has lost his life for My sake will find it.” When we truly follow Jesus, we have to lose our own lives. Often this can feel like everything is in upheaval, it can be painful, and it is definitely not easy. But this inside-out, upside-down approach is the path that leads us to life. </p><p>If you have experienced loss, confusion, or hurt in your pursuit of Jesus, be encouraged. This is not an indicator that you have done something wrong or that you have lost your way. In fact, it probably means that you are right on the path to finding true life. </p><p>I don’t know what 2020 has in store for you, but this I do know - God doesn’t waste our hurt, He doesn’t give up on us, and He can redeem even the most painful circumstances. </p><p><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p>God, thank you that You have the power to make sense of the confusion and chaos of my soul.  Help me see life from Your perspective. I want to pursue true life, even when I can’t see or understand the process. I choose to find hope in You. Amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1576898574874-BK2WT2PWPBMMA01VP9KO/insideout.jpg,568
569,Don't Block The Light,post,2020-01-14 23:59:00,,/blogfeed/dontblockthelight,<p>Today’s blog was written by Jonathan Hickory.</p>,"<p>A few nights ago, I was reading a Berenstain Bears story with my 3-year-old son.  We sat together on the bed, his eyes wide as we turned through the colorful pages. In the story that we were reading, Sister Bear was scared of “spooky shadows.”  Trying to comfort his daughter, Papa Bear told her, “<em>Shadows happen when something blocks the light</em>.""</p><p>As I read these words out loud to my son…it struck me, right then. The shadows in our life...the darkness we feel in our hearts—comes when we allow things to block the light.</p><p>""God is light; in him there is no darkness at all."" -1 John 1:5</p><p>God is the LIGHT that fills our souls with joy and true peace.  </p><p>Things like pride, lust, material things, unforgiveness, bitterness and our own evil desires can very easily block Him from fully changing our hearts. The shadows cast into our hearts as a result fill our hearts and our lives with darkness.</p><p>Romans 13:12 tells us, “lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.”  For God’s light protects us, as strong armor protects a warrior on the battlefield.</p><p>Don't block His light. Open your heart to God fully and allow the Light in--and He will fill you with the <strong><em>joy</em></strong> and the <strong><em>peace</em></strong> that come from walking with Him as you LIVE as a Child of the Light.</p><p> </p><p>“For you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk as children of Light.”    -Ephesians 5:8</p><p> Prayer:  Heavenly Father, guard our hearts and minds, our very souls, against the darkness.  Fill us with Your love and your LIGHT and help us to reflect Your light to others.  Amen.</p><p> </p><p></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1580860731083-VU27QQHYU3Q7RZMI4T6L/jonathan.jpg,570
571,You Asked for It,post,2022-11-30 19:30:00,leadwell,/blogfeed/leadwell2022q4,,"<h2><strong>Lead Well Q4 2022</strong></h2><p><br/>There was one question that I did not have time to cover in last night’s Lead Well teaching, but it’s a very important question for every leader:<br/></p><h3><strong>How do you delegate well?</strong></h3><p>The key to delegation is understanding what delegation is, and knowing the difference between delegation and abdication. Let’s define these two words.</p><p></p><blockquote><p>Delegation - the process of entrusting and empowering</p><p>Abdication - failure to fulfill a responsibility or duty</p></blockquote><p></p><p>With delegation a process and a progression are involved. Think of good delegation happening in five stages.</p><p></p><h3><strong>The Five Stages of Delegation</strong></h3><p><strong>1. I do.</strong></p><p>You cannot lead where you have not been. Jesus has never asked us to do anything that he has not first done himself.</p><p><strong>2. I do, you watch.</strong></p><p>Invite another person or others into the process. Give the why and teach the how. Why is the most important question to answer, but how is a close second.</p><p><strong>3. We do together</strong>.</p><p>It’s at this point that many of us abdicate because we’re relieved to have it off our plate, or because it feels inefficient, but this is the most critical step. Skipping this step means you haven’t delegated, you’ve dumped. That’s not responsible leadership. Give responsibility, be present, and follow up with evaluation and feedback.</p><p>What’s Right, Wrong, Confusing, Missing? Accentuate what’s right. Fix what’s wrong. Clarify what’s confusing. Add what’s missing.</p><p><strong>4. You do, I watch.</strong></p><p>You’re now hands off and observing. This step is followed by evaluation and feedback.</p><p><strong>5. You do. </strong></p><p>You’ve followed the process and the progression, and while it may have felt inefficient, it will save so much time and confusion in the long run. The doing is still followed by evaluation and feedback. Jesus modeled this with the 72 in <strong>Luke 10:17-20: </strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>17 The seventy-two returned with joy and said, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name.” 18 He replied, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. 19 I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you. 20 However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”</strong></p><p><strong>Luke 10:17-20 NIV </strong></p></blockquote><p>With you and for you, </p><p>Pastor Gabe </p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1668108619903-CAWPBBW6MP08M29CA6LD/Lead+Well+Q4+%282%29.png,572
573,My Journey to Find my Identity in Christ,post,2019-11-19 15:59:43,,/blogfeed/my-journey-to-find-my-identity-in-christ,<p>Today’s blog is written by Alex Timmons.</p>,"<p><strong>Today’s Reading:</strong></p><p>Matthew 7: 24-27</p><p>“Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it” (ESV)</p><p>I became a Christian at a very young age, I grew up in a Christian household, I went to vacation bible school, youth retreats, and even a Christian college. I have heard this passage many times in my life, even in song format. However, up until a few years ago, I never really allowed a core message of this passage influence the way I live out my everyday life: place your identity in Christ and let the truth of your redemption be the foundation that informs your decisions. </p><p>What I did instead was allow my identity to be governed by external things that are fleeting and change with the circumstances of life. Among my friend groups growing up, I was always the “smart one.” I soon came to not only embrace that label, but let it define me. This pattern can be seen most clearly when I look at my college years. I remember many weekends where I would prioritize studying or classwork over going to church. I let the fear of not performing well academically keep me from the best that God had to offer me. My error here did not end when I walked across the stage at graduation; it transitioned easily to the “real world.” Simply replace classrooms for office buildings and grades with performance reviews. </p><p>Eventually, I realized this pattern I had allowed myself to fall into. The amazing part is that the fix is simple, because God does the heavy lifting. All I had to do was come to Him with a repentant heart in earnest prayer. When we do this, we are simply allowing space for the Holy Spirit to work in our lives. </p><p>I am still not perfect in this area, but I have seen a real tangible change in my life since I started actively trying to apply this principal. When I inevitably make a mistake a work, because I am human, it does not rock my world or ruin my whole day. Don’t get me wrong, I still try to do my best at whatever I work at, but I am now free from the burden of thinking I have to perform perfectly because I know that at the end of the day what really matters is embracing my spiritual identity and gifts and using them to help bring the kingdom of God here on earth.</p><p><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p><em>Lord, help me to remember that my identity is not based in the fleeting things of this world; to remember that my identity is only truly fulfilled when I am working for your glory.</em></p><p><br/></p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1574178408819-OJYQB6CVTIDS5NEXOHT6/Untitled-2.jpg,574
575,Prayer,post,2020-01-22 00:00:00,,/blogfeed/prayer,<p>Today’s blog was written by Debbie Fletcher.</p>,"<p>I came to know the Lord as an adult, and I happened to attend a church where praying out loud by individuals was part of every Sunday morning worship.  To begin with I thought Christians had another language I was not aware of.   I would listen as the people in this congregation would lift up beautiful prayers.  I was mesmerized as the sweetest words would be spoken.  I did not grow up in church or really ever hear much of any type of prayer being lifted.  After hearing them I really felt like I could never utter any words out loud for others to hear.  I felt my words would never be worthy in comparison. </p><p>After our first year at this church and our first year living for the Lord, a little boy in the church – maybe 6 years old was diagnosed with cancer.  This was a smaller church maybe 250 people.  One Sunday morning they brought this little boy up front to pray over him, many people got up to surround him physically and I felt the power of that prayer like nothing I had experienced before.  The next visit to the doctors, the report was that he did not have one bit of cancer in his little body.  My heart just beat for prayer from that moment on.  It still took me a while longer to be able to utter prayer out loud.  I began small, just a sentence, and that was for some reason excruciating.  But I continued to be faithful and talk to God out loud among others.  That is really all prayer is, talking to God and listening for His voice.  As we obey God and open our hearts to Him, He will do in us what we cannot do – change our hearts.  </p><p>We don’t need to have any “right, correct” words, we just need to have a heart to communicate with and hear from Him.  He does not analyze our words or the way we say them, He only wants our hearts.</p><p>Have you ever thought about the idea that when you pray aloud, you also allow others to have a connection with God in a way they perhaps would not have known?   That perhaps you would be giving others confidence and examples to draw from?  When we are with others who are praying, we are standing in agreement with them as they speak to the Lord.  We are opening our hearts and asking our Lord to come in and abide in us.</p><p>When the Bible says “pray without ceasing” – the concept is not that we need to be praying words aloud all day, but that we say in a mindset of prayer.  The more we practice this the more it becomes our heartbeat.</p><p>The Lord is wanting to hear from us.  What is your next step?  Do you have a prayer time to be alone with God?  Maybe your next step is to say a sentence prayer out loud at group or a gathering? Maybe it is time to join our prayer team.  Wherever God nudges you, He desires for us to be in fellowship with Him and for us to live in freedom and abundance.</p><p>Father, thank you for loving us so much that our fellowship with you is what you desire most.  Give us opportunity to give you our heart and sit at your feet.  We love you and praise you!  Amen </p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1580861156430-VT2XNJHREQ76SRJEOP34/68781_Prayer.jpg,576
577,Residing Joy,post,2022-12-17 17:22:13,,/blogfeed/residing-joy-adventdevo,<p>A blog by Kristin Fields </p>,"<h1>Residing Joy</h1><blockquote><p><em>“The angel reassured them. “Don’t be afraid!” he said. “I bring you good news that will bring great joy to all people. The Savior—yes, the Messiah, the Lord—has been born today in Bethlehem, the city of David! And you will recognize him by this sign: You will find a baby wrapped snugly in strips of cloth, lying in a manger.” </em></p><p><em>Suddenly, the angel was joined by a vast host of others—the armies of heaven—praising God and saying, “Glory to God in the highest heaven, and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased.</em>” (Luke 2:10-14 NLT)</p></blockquote><h3>What news can bring great joy to all people?</h3><p>Only one announcement can bring exceedingly great joy to every person ever created regardless of culture and century.</p><p>C.S. Lewis wrote, </p><blockquote><p>“The Son of God became a man to enable men to become sons of God.”</p></blockquote><p>God sent His Son to reconcile all people to Himself. The eternal rift between souls and God, which cannot be restored from our side, was bridged by Christ. When we receive His rescue, the promises of God become our life’s foundation. We are released from the penalty of sinful choices. Our despair is revolutionized by hope. As His Spirit leads, we experience a residing joy and a sense of well being that is not dependent on circumstances. Being restored to God, we are given the Holy Spirit who is the source of this joy (see Galatians 5:22).</p><p>The announcement of Jesus’ birth led the angels to rejoice knowing what he would accomplish.</p><p>The people of this time knew too well the effect of rebellion against God. Not only were they living under political tyranny and oppression, but God had withdrawn His presence to honor His people’s repeated unbelief and the resulting idolatry. For approximately 400 years God held Himself back from His people until this undeserved moment when <em>“the Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.” </em>(John 1:14) </p><p>For these first-century people the birth of Jesus was such brilliant news that the despair which taunts humankind was pushed back by exceedingly great joy - and will be forevermore.</p><p>May this joy eclipse whatever attempts to overshadow your heart. </p><p>Angels and the radiance of God’s glory may not be manifesting in the sky over your head, but you have something better. You have Immanuel, God with you, and He is pleased with you! </p><blockquote><p><em>“The LORD your God is with you, the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you; in his love he will no longer rebuke you, but will rejoice over you with singing.” </em>(Zephaniah 3:17)</p></blockquote><h3>PRAYER</h3><p>Father, thank You for sending Jesus to rescue me. You are the source and giver of all joy. Today I choose to believe that You rejoice because I am Your child and I rejoice with You. Please help me to remember this eternal truth. Thank you, Jesus.

579,Taking Down The Tree,post,2019-12-24 15:00:00,,/blogfeed/takingdownthetree,<p>Today’s blog was written by Bonnie Russman.</p>,"<p><strong>Scripture</strong> <strong>Verse</strong>:  So whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God.  1 Cor. 10:31.</p><p>Now that Christmas is over, most of our Christmas trees have been or will be taken down and the ornaments put away for another year.  Have you ever wondered why putting up the tree is more fun than taking it down?  I have, and I’ve noticed other things as well. For instance, I always enjoy setting the table for a special dinner more than clearing it after the dinner guests have left.  And packing for a family vacation is much more compelling and exciting than unpacking.  Perhaps the answer lies not so much with our after-Christmas let-down than with facing what comes next – the unspecial, unspectacular return to our normal lives – day to normal day.</p><p>Let’s face it, God calls us to be “Everyday Christians” for the majority of our lives, but sometimes hidden there in the ordinary is our true value, our identity, and our unique calling to a life of extraordinary faithfulness, consistency, service, and love.  </p><p> When Mary and Martha were blessed with the thrill of hosting our Savior in their own home, what do you imagine they did after He left?  They probably cleaned up and did the dishes!  After John the Baptist was given the honor of baptizing our Lord in the Jordan River, he no doubt returned to his preaching ministry.  In Matthew we read the miraculous account of Christ’s Transfiguration, but what happened next?  Jesus came down from the mountain and was immediately met with crowds of people who were seeking Him, and to whom He spoke and ministered.  Even the Son of God had his day to day work to do, work to which He was called by the Father! </p><p>What is your day to day work?  Where has the Father placed you in this world and what has He given you to do?  Whether it seems great or small, average or special, are you performing it with the faithfulness of John the Baptist, the consistency of Mary and Martha, and the love of Christ?  While the Christmas mornings and mountaintop experiences can be great blessings in our lives, w<em>ho we truly are</em> can more often be found every day in our homes, offices, churches and schools, where God sees our everyday faithfulness and is pleased. </p><p>In Luke 10, there was much rejoicing when Jesus’ disciples returned having ministered to the people with great power and success. But Jesus wisely reminded them that what really mattered is that their names are written down in heaven.  Indeed, this is where their true worth and identity was to be found – in belonging to God.  Likewise, we are not insignificant, and nothing we do is insignificant as long as we are in Him and are found faithful to Him. </p><p><strong>Prayer</strong>:  Lord, thank you for calling me to a life of service, for equipping me for that work, and for using me to further your kingdom.  I rejoice that you know my name and it is written in heaven.  Please help me to be the very best Christian that I can be, serving you and others with a glad and humble heart, whether on the mountains or in the valleys, but mostly in the every days in between.  Amen.</p>",http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1576897992560-AWVUC0JSZ19723IQVFHN/tttt.jpg,580

God is faithful, and He will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation He will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.” (1 Corinthians 10:13, ESV) </p><p>No matter how seemingly impossible your situation may appear, whether you are battling addiction, depression, anxiety, or stress, know that God always provides a way of escape. If God’s Word tells us there is a way out, expect Him to show up and provide a way for you.</p><p>At an early age, I used drugs to escape a reality that seemed impossible to live sober. I did not listen to what God’s Word said, and as a result, I found myself in a desert for the better part of ten years. It was not until I fully surrendered my life to Christ, and accepted that I could not fix myself, that I began to climb out of the hole I had found myself in. At this point, I yearned to change my life, and wanted to be a better person. I went to a faith-based recovery rehab for one year and had an encounter with God that changed the whole trajectory of my life.</p><p>I want you to know if you are struggling with addiction, reach out to someone who loves you and tell them what is going on. There is no shame in admitting you have a problem. We were not created to live in isolation; rather, in community with like-minded people.  </p><p>Here at The Point, we offer a group for men in recovery.
