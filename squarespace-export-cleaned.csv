104,Power in Weakness | One Verse Blog - Day 1,post,2017-10-10 21:02:00,One Verse,/blogfeed/2017/10/10/power-in-weakness-one-verse-blog-day-1,Today’s blog is written by Jenn Buxton as she starts of our One Verse series of blogs.,"Today’s Reading “But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.” -2 Corinthians 12:9-10 (ESV) Ever since we were born, society has told us that weakness is bad and inferior. That said, it can be easy to fall into a pit of self-pity or self-doubt when life gets hard. It’s easy to question ourselves – whether it be our abilities, our strengths, or our weaknesses. However, Jesus’ ministry is full of individuals who were seemingly weak, inferior, or disliked. Jesus took the least of these and used them to make an eternal impact for the kingdom. In 2 Corinthians, Paul tells us that when we are weak God can show up and blow our minds. I think we see God’s strength the most in our lives when we ...",

Read as she shares how to walk as new creation and to surrender our ways to God’s when we deal with conflict. Today’s Reading “Everything—and I do mean everything—connected with that old way of life has to go. It’s rotten through and through. Get rid of it! And then take an entirely new way of life—a God-fashioned life, a life renewed from the inside and working itself into your conduct as God accurately reproduces His character in you.” -Ephesians 4:22-24 MSG So, you read the title—possibly intrigued, but pretty confident that you know what’s coming next. But do you really? In our current series, My Way , Pastor Gabe is teaching on conflict. I want to be upfront and honest and say that my biggest source of conflict, a majority of the time, is me. When my desires become more important than the needs of others, when I am offended because someone said something that struck a nerve deep down revealing something about myself and I become defensive, I...",

Today’s Reading “David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the Lord.” And Nathan said to David, “The Lord also has put away your sin; you shall not die. Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the Lord, the child who is born to you shall die.” -2 Samuel 12:13-14 When I was a child, I occasionally attended Sunday school with an aunt when I would stay overnight at her house. The trouble with attending Sunday school irregularly is that I got a somewhat irregular education about famed Bible characters. I remember learning about Bible characters like they were superheroes. I saw illustrations of Moses, staff in hand, standing before the parted Red Sea. I saw Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego huddled together with flames surrounding them but never hurting them. And I saw the child David, clutching a slingshot, ready to battle the terrifying Goliath. What I didn’t understand then was that the real superhero of these scenarios...",

162,Take a Look Inside,post,2018-10-08 18:16:00,,/blogfeed/2018/10/8/take-a-look-inside,Today’s blog is written by Amber Parker on finding ourselves in conflict and taking a look inside.,"Have you ever been a part of a toxic environment? The kind that is full of fighting, gossip, anger, and backbiting? It could be a workplace, a team, or even your home. We have all experienced them. These types of places seem to pull people in and wrap them up in drama. When we are surrounded by unhealthy behavior it is very easy to be sucked right into it. It is also easy to blame our own behavior on the situation, the environment, or the actions of others. This kind of thinking is exactly what James addresses when he writes to the early church. In chapter 4, James begins with this question, “What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you?” Then he gives an answer that probably surprised his readers, “Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you? You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask. You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrongly, to spend it on your own pass...",

Just as I have loved you, you are also to love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.” –John 13:34-35 Food is my love language. Yes, I know it doesn’t make the list made popular by the famous book by Gary Chapman. We’ve all taken the assessments and should find ourselves in one of the five categories: • Words of affirmation • Quality time • Receiving gifts • Acts of service • Physical touch But for me, nothing I do compares to the overwhelming satisfaction I get when I cook for someone, have fellowship with friends, or plan our meals. Even grocery shopping makes me smile. No matter what our cultural background is, the preparation and eating of food is something we all have in common with one another. And it is in the ...",

Let us come before him with thanksgiving and extol him with music and song.” -Psalm 95:1-2 Imagine the scene on Christmas morning. Everyone is gathered around the Christmas tree and the gifts are being distributed. There are two children present. The first child reacts with gratitude to everything they receive, even if they already have one or an item doesn’t quite fit right. The second child is difficult to please and nothing is quite right. There is a complaint, groan or face for everything received. Which child enjoys Christmas most? The first child surely does because attitude makes all the difference – and this is true every day of the year, not just on Christmas morning. The Christmas morning example is like a snapshot of life. Some are thankful, and others continuously dwell on the negative. When we are ...",

Read as he shares about how God pursues us as children and what it means to be a child of God. My beloved son turns two years old in a few days. Lately, he loves to play a game with me where he will run tirelessly through the endless grass in our backyard, looking back to see if I am running after him. He has no direction, he has no destination, but he knows he is running from me. To his delight, I pursue him, his little legs moving as fast as they can while my pace remains even, steady, and unwavering. “Chase me, Daddy! Chase me!” he giggles with glee as his blonde hair reflects the warm sunlight. As he looks backwards, sometimes he stumbles and sometimes he tumbles, only to have me leap on top of him and sweep him up into my arms, embracing him with unsurpassable joy and endless love. We laugh together and I find myself overjoyed to share in his laughter and wonder. How often do we, as children of God, run from our Heavenly Father? How oft...",

Today’s Reading “For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction, that through perseverance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.” -Romans 15:4 – NASB Have you ever been discouraged? Each of us has probably experienced some form of discouragement at one time or another; I certainly have. We’ve all felt sad, let down or disappointed, but true discouragement goes deeper than mere surface feelings. The dictionary defines discouragement as the loss of confidence or courage – to be disheartened. True discouragement is in many ways akin to a broken heart. As Christ followers, we know that He dwells in our hearts, along with our own faith in Him, and hope, and love. And if the joy of the Lord is our strength, how could a child of God lose these precious gifts and give way to discouragement? Sometimes we forget, for a moment, that our powerful, lovin...",

It’s cold outside. You’re watching your favorite Christmas special. Your children are playing on the floor in the light of your Christmas tree. In the chaos of your life and the Christmas season, everything seems calm and right in the world, even if it’s just for that evening. Suddenly the peace and quiet get interrupted with a phone call. It’s a warning that there is an army approaching your community and you have 15 minutes to flee. It’s a high likelihood that if you’re there when the army arrives, you and your sons will be tortured and killed, and your wife and daughters will be raped. What do you take with you? What gets left behind? While it’s hard for us to imagine a scenario this tragic and disturbing, this is the reality of many Syrian and Iraqi refugees who were forced to leave their war-torn countries finding refuge in Jordan from both Isis and other fighting armies.

Today’s Reading “His soul shall be satisfied on Mount Ephraim and Gilead.” -Jeremiah 50:19 “Our Spiritual appetite can only be satisfied with Jesus.” -Nicky Gumbel. Would I be satisfied if I were to lose our Christmas holiday decorations, our lights, our presents, our food, even our Christmas parties if I were to just have Jesus? The scripture reference is from Jeremiah in which Jeremiah is trying to teach the readers the promises of God. One of the promises Jeremiah mentions is God wants the readers to be satisfied by the Lord alone. If we were to simply remember Jesus being born and the sacrifice it took our Heavenly Father to give Jesus to the world, would we still be satisfied? Satisfaction, or contentment at the core means being fulfilled. Nothing else needs to be added or given to be satisfied. My husband and I have been married for a little over 3 years and at the beginning o...",

Read as he shares how his family christmas traditions help him focus on the true meaning of Christmas. Christmas traditions are something I think we all secretly wait for every year. For many of us, we seem to have some we remember from our childhood, and now maybe even cling to as adults. When I look back to my childhood and Christmas, now as an adult, I truly love the tradition of putting up the Christmas tree. For us, a real pine tree is not an option, our cats like to eat it! The picturesque pulling out of that fake Dillard from the box we store it in, is a thing of beauty! Of course, we always add some type of lights, only to find that one lightbulb that doesn’t work! Probably one of my favorite things is putting up our ornaments. They are from the places we’ve traveled, the things we enjoy, older ones I made as a child, to the ones we received from other family members. I love to think about what the ornament means and how it impacts me and...",

Read as she shares with us how she chooses to rejoice in the hope Jesus brings even in seasons of darkness. “When they saw the star, they were filled with joy!” -Matthew 2:10 When I was a little girl my parents allowed me to have a tiny tree in my bedroom. Picture a plump version of a Charlie Brown tree with bright white and multi-colored lights. The dazzling lights against the tinsel mesmerized me for weeks! The joy of the upcoming day was almost too much to contain. I felt like I was going to burst. I would belt out the verses of Jingle Bells and Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer along with the classic hymns of Silent Night and O Come All Ye Faithful as I caroled with my friends. A lot has changed since then; my tree is much bigger, my life more complex, but the twinkle of the holiday lights and the sound of the music still sparks excitement in my heart.

She shares her experience in the Philippines with her fellow teammates and how God is working and doing amazing things there! At 38, I thought to myself, there has to be more to my walk with the Lord than leading a small group and serving at church on Sundays. I had a deep stirring in my heart to want more of Jesus, to know Him deeper and to serve Him greater. So, I took a step in faith and headed to the Philippines to serve with my church. God showed me more on this trip. I gained brothers and sisters in Christ. I saw God’s greatness through instantly answered prayers. I learned to love deeper than I ever knew I could. I experienced love with no boundaries and I learned our ministry shouldn’t either. This mission trip changed my life. We helped construct a church in a village that was a day’s walk from the main road – so thankful for our vehicle! There were so many children and adults and not many s...",

I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. 13 I can do all this through him who gives me strength. 14 Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles.” -Philippians 4:10-14 Paul wrote these words as he sat in a prison cell condemned for his faith, awaiting an uncertain fate. This section of his letter was basically a ‘thank you note’ to the Philippian church, which had sent him a financial gift. It’s interesting that Paul “rejoiced g...",

This past Sunday we wrapped up this series, and if you weren’t able to be with us, or you missed a week or two, I want to encourage you to visit our website and catch up on the messages. Many of you have requested a list of all the Scriptures that I referenced throughout this series. While these verses are some of the verses that I pray over myself each morning, there are many others that I did not share in the series. As you pray over yourself, the list below is a good starting point, but I would encourage you to search the Scriptures for yourself and ask God to give you specific verses in addition to these to use as a guide for prayer. Here’s one last suggestion. After praying these verses over yourself each morning, carry the cards with you throughout the day and take 10 minutes over lunch, or while you’re waiti...",

And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” Philippians 4:6-7 (NIV) Each year when the leaves fall and the seasons change, I enter a state of seasonal depression. The darkness of the autumn months fills me with dread and sorrow that feels never-ending. Maybe it is because some of the most difficult moments in my life happened in the fall, or maybe it’s the physical darkness in the sky each morning when I leave for work and in the evening when I get home. Nevertheless, every year, without fail, the fall season brings about a terrible anxiety that I cannot shake - until last year. In Fall 2018, I began to learn more about prayer and decided to be more intentional with my prayer life. I started attending the prayer group at The Point with that intention in mind. Little did I...",

We didn’t really know what to expect, so we were prepared to do whatever the Lord called us to do. We were equipped with medicine, medical supplies, oral hygiene items, children’s toys, and anything else we could stuff into thirteen suitcases. Our first day of clinic was at a remote village located about two hours north of Lome, the country’s capital. In the village’s church building, we set up a triage area, provider stations, and a pharmacy, anticipating we would see around 200-300 patients. We were quickly overwhelmed by the needs of the people we saw: worms, malaria, wounds, hypertension were a few of the many conditions we diagnosed. By the end of the day, vi...",

The prayer of a person living right with God is something powerful to be reckoned with.” James 5:16 (MSG) The story of how my 23-year-old cousin Ben lived; it starts, in fact, five days before he died. His mom, my Aunt Barbara, woke up on a Sunday morning this past April with a strong feeling she should fast that morning and pray instead of eating breakfast. And on Monday morning, she felt the same way. This feeling continued for four days, resulting in a water or black-tea-only fast until 10:30 each morning, at which point she would allow herself coffee with milk and food for breakfast. On the fifth day, as Aunt Barbara was fasting, my cousin Ben was on a short morning jog about 30 minutes away, when his heart stopped, and he collapsed on the pavement. His jogging route had taken him through future housing developments that were paused in their construction, where his body would have p...",

And it was not paid with mere gold or silver, which lose their value. It was the precious blood of Christ, the sinless, spotless Lamb of God.” (1 Peter 1:18-19 NLT) Performance, possessions, and popularity – Does that sound like a miserable flashback to high school or what? If only that trio faded into ancient history like SAT scores. It seems though we have a natural tendency to believe these equate our value far into adulthood. Even Jesus was tempted to prove himself in these key areas. As we read the temptation of Jesus, we see he was first taunted to “command these stones to become loaves of bread.” (Matthew 4:3) Satan was prodding Jesus to prove himself. Ring a bell? Years ago, I met a famous preacher and the first thing she said to me was, “What do you do?” I don’t know why she asked that question.

Along with that word I search the scriptures to find a verse that speaks to my heart about the growth I sense God wants for me. This year, I felt God was directing me to a word that most people are leery of asking for – patience. To paraphrase an old saying: If you pray for patience, God will present you with trials to give you an opportunity to develop patience. And this year He has done just that. As I searched the scriptures for the right verses to memorize and focus on, God lead me to Psalm 37, where He lays out a “formula” if you will with four steps to develop a heart and mind of patience. Step 1: Trust God: “Trust in the Lord, and do good; dwell in the land and befriend faithfulness.” v.3 Our first step is to trust in God and seek to do His will – to be good and faithful in the place that He has us, knowing He will never leave or forsake us. So we ask ourselves – Am I willing to truly trust t...",

He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.” – Ephesians 3:20 (TPT) When we experience seasons of loss, financial burden, uncertainty or waiting, we may feel that God is more of a foe than a friend. Is God who He says He is? Or is He the God of the circumstances that I am experiencing? I recently walked through a season where I questioned just that - ‘Is God always kind to me?’ I had a clear vision about what the next phase of my life should look like, but God didn’t reveal the fruit I was hoping for. My lens became focused on this direction, while God kept nudging me down a different path. In the fall of 2018, I joined The Point’s prayer group, which quickly became one of the biggest blessings of my life. While I continued to ask God to change my circumstance...",

(Ephesians 2:19-22 NIV) This past October nine men went on a mission trip to San Pedro, Mexico. We partnered with Advancing Native Missions and built a two-story building in place of a 40-year-old structure that needed to be demolished and removed.

He will rejoice over you with gladness; He will quiet you with His love; He will rejoice over you with singing.” WOW. God SINGS over us with JOY? GRATITUDE is in all 66 books of the Bible, and it’s an almost overwhelming exercise in joy to study it! Gratitude includes awe; praise; thankfulness; glory, joy, wonder, worship, exultation. God made us in His Image, and we are hard-wired for gratitude just like we are hard-wired for worship; it is in our spiritual DNA. Reading through the Bible… through all the troubles, sins, wars, and heartaches; EVEN SO, there is a golden thread from Genesis to Revelation, running through the whole sacred cloth! ANYTHING repeated in so many different iterations, deserves attention. It greatly matters to God. Gratitude shows up in Genesis 2:23, when Adam first saw Eve.

Lamentations 5:15 Is it really that bad? She was old. She lived a long life. She loved me. She didn’t suffer. She was only sick for 17 days. All of those things make logical sense and yet I am still mourning. My 91-year-old mother passed away this past March after a 17 day illness. I always thought that if someone was old then it wasn’t a big deal to lose them. I have learned that it doesn’t work that way. Loss is loss. As I face this first Christmas without my mom and see how challenging it is, I am newly aware of all of the people I know who have lost loved ones in the past. Was I kind and considerate during their “firsts” for the next year or two? I am ashamed to say I don’t know that I was. I want to do better.

I did not know what to expect, but I had a sense of anticipation for what God was going to do. Of course, I had fears and anxieties as well but as I boarded our flight there was an overwhelming sense of God’s presence. I was not alone, not just because there were also 10 fabulous women going along but because the Holy Spirit was right there with me. Our time in Cuba was divided between serving in the local church and community and a women’s conference at a camp outside of Havana. The theme for the conference was the Holy Spirit.

As I got older, there were a few times that I found myself falling to my knees, my face bowed to the floor, coming to God - and I remember them vividly. Each time was out of desperation. I don’t remember the words, but the feeling of connection to my Father- that stuck with me. Over time, I’ve realized that it’s never been the words that mattered to God. God is not concerned with how articulate we are, he’s concerned with our hearts. And the reason those desperate fall-to-my-knees moments are so etched in my heart are because they were turning points in my relationship with Him-- from knowing about Him to knowing Him. As Jesus sends out his disciples, preparing them for persecution in spreading the Gospel, he says, “do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say, for what you are to...",

When I was very young, I would watch churchgoers lift their eyes from their bibles when the pastor asked them to begin reciting the Lord’s prayer - in the King James, of course!

Our desire was to meet people and build new friendships. God taught us that it is much more than just meeting people and there is great value to biblical fellowship. It is a great place to make friends, learn more about Christ and live life with other believers. ...",

246,In Everything - Pray,post,2019-02-05 01:23:00,Pray First,/blogfeed/2019/2/4/in-everything-pray,Today’s blog is written by Trevor & Kelly Gach on how to pray in everything.,"“Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” ( Philippians 4:6-7 ). “Be joyful always; pray continually; give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.” ( 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 ). How simple these verses make it sound to constantly be praying and giving thanks, yet how often do we feel like the world is crashing around us and we have nowhere to turn. What does it even mean to pray continually, or without ceasing ? Try thinking of it like keeping the line of communication open with God at all times. We might not be able to be on our knees in prayer 24-7-365, but we can keep our heart and mind open to hearing God in everything we do. We can also seek him first in our everyday decisions rather than last. Too often prayer becomes an afterthought, an option, or ...",

Ecc. 9:10a As a mother of only one child – a daughter who has no children of her own – I confess to having an occasional case of “Grandma Envy”! I have often longed to have a little one of my own to hold, kiss, care for and love, and have sometimes jealously watched my friends doting on their precious grandchildren, spending time with them, and talking enthusiastically about them as they share their photographs and stories. While I can rejoice in their happiness and blessings, my own desires and disappointments are still there, lurking just beneath the surface of my emotions. Shortly after joining The Point, I remember vividly that one Sunday Pastor Gabe brought out a large fishing net onto the stage and invited several Point volunteers to come out and hold the net with him. He encouraged each of us in the congregation to “Get your hands on the net” and find the right place to volunteer. He mentioned several a...",

Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. 1 John 4:7-8. (NIV) Love This past January my team and I spent ten days serving the Aeta people of the Philippines. The Aeta are thought to be one of the earliest, if not the first, inhabitants of the Philippines living primarily in isolated, and mountainous regions of the island of Luzon. Despite their long history, the Aeta have faced devastating social and economic marginalization and displacement. During our time, we traveled to a village and spent three days building a church and living alongside the Aeta ministering, serving and “doing life” with them. After our extended time in this village we traveled to two other remote villages and were able to worship and feed more of the Aeta people. We concluded our trip by spending a few days on campus with our ministry partner the Aeta Bible Study Cen...",

We are called to serve. There is no way to debate that statement. In some way, shape or form, we are to serve in the ways that the Lord created us. I have been attending The Point for about three years when I took a bold step out of my comfort zone and said, “Here I am, Lord. Use me to serve you.” That was the breakthrough moment when I felt at home and experienced the fullness of Christ. I felt like I was thriving. I was not thriving because of anything I did, but rather what the Lord did through me. He clearly showed me how I needed to serve when I made that step of obedience. Serving starts with the right mindset. One thing that I have learned during my time serving is the more I operate with the mindset of everything I do is serving the Lord , the more I find a complete and whole joy within myself and what I do. There have been ...",

This trip did many things for my faith, but the single greatest was how it opened my eyes that the land we read about in the Bible was not a fantasy or mythological Narnia but is a legit place. My eyes were opened that the Bible shows us the past, impacts my faith today and taught me what’s going to happen tomorrow. Yesterday: I’ve read the Bible since I was in preschool, but I always thought of it as a story and not a real, physical place. In Israel, I got to stand next to a tree in the Garden of Gethsemane that was older than our country. It’s amazing to walk the path that Jesus used on the way to be crucified and think about the markets all around and people in the street watching. This was not how I pictured it or saw it in Veggie Tales cartoons as a kid. In Cesarea, standing wh...",

This is the place where we really get to know each other. We are part of a growing, vibrant church where new people join us each week. This is a blessing from God, but it also means that we can’t easily care for each other in the large body of Christ. So just as Paul sent Timothy “to strengthen and encourage you in your faith” I Thess. 3:3, I have seen many “Timothys” carrying each other’s burdens in the women’s group I lead and the group I attend in the evening.

Needless to say her plants and flowers were amazing and I always admired her gardening skills. One summer evening she called me and said, “Bonnie, be in my back yard tonight at 9:00 pm.” I couldn’t imagine what she wanted, but I was intrigued and just curious enough to comply. When I arrived, she pointed out one of her large plants, and told me to keep my eyes on it. As we both stood there watching, I was astonished to see, at precisely 9:00, a beautiful, perfectly formed, mature flower literally “pop” open right before our eyes! The plant was an Evening Primrose, and I was delighted to watch as its other flowers also popped open one by one - I had never seen anything like it.

Stanley, a sandy beige colored tomcat with a sweet and affectionate personality, was raised in our home lovingly since he was adopted as a very small kitten. Simon, a jet black, rambunctious, yet strikingly handsome fellow, was adopted as a young adult cat. Stanley and Simon are always together, like two peas in a pod. When I go outside with my children on a beautiful sunny day, both cats come running up to get their due allowance of petting and human time. Stanley allows me to pet him and doesn’t seem to care when my children pull his tail or rub his fur the wrong way. Simon, however, is a different story. I almost always get a glimpse of his unknown past-as he seeks attention and allows me to pet him, only to suddenly sink his teeth into my hand as I stroke his midnight black coat. And while so many people would just refuse to have any contact with that seemingly spiteful and ungrateful cat, I continue to work with him. Over time, with love, Simon has improved with h...",

Consider the following fictional scenario: Kate’s sweet and thoughtful daughter Akira has been invaded by the body snatchers. Or maybe just a wicked case of teenage hormones from the fiery nether regions. Akira’s constant put downs and outright contempt drag Kate into the pit of despair. Every night, she tosses and turns, wracked with anxiety over the state of the relationship. Every morning, she kicks herself, knowing today will not be the day she has enough energy to sign up for the volunteer project she’s been avoiding. Is there anything Kate could be doing differently? For months now, she’s been begging God to change Akira’s heart, to no avail. “ Could it be, Lord, she prayed , that You are using Akira to ...",

My mom was an alcoholic and I grew up in a very dysfunctional family. I was the oldest of 3 children and it was made known all through my life that I was an annoyance and inconvenience to her. As I got older her only words to me were that of “I wasn’t good enough or lovable or couldn’t do anything right.” I moved out as soon as I turned 18. Several years later when Lee and I got married, we both came to know the Lord. I knew this unforgiveness of my mom was not what God wanted for me, but I could not come to grips with the anger I felt toward my mom. My walk with the Lord was getting stronger and He was growing me, as I stepped out of my comfort zone in obedience to Him. But I still had this unforgiveness toward my mom hanging over my head. About 5 years ago, I was so sick and tired of this cycle I was in and wanted so desperately to be free of...",

My dad had turned a life of drugs and alcohol into a life of pursuing Christ, which for him meant becoming a youth pastor. When I say we were always at church, I often felt like I saw the walls of our youth room more than my own house. People would say things like, “thank you for all that you do with our church,” or “you’re always serving with such a grateful heart.” At times I loved what we did at church and the ways we were able to help and serve others, but by the end of high school it was something I felt I had to do, since I was the “youth pastor’s kid.” I went off to college and attended church, but never truly got “plugged in.” I told myself I was too busy or it would stress me out too much with school, but the truth was I...",

One of the reasons why I love this verse is because our example, Jesus, never calls us to do anything he hasn’t already done for all of us. The King of kings was born in a manger, humbled himself, and took a lowly position as a servant. Around this time last year, I was not serving or volunteering at the Point. I didn’t really have an understanding of why I should serve and the significance of serving. The reason why I joined was because I was listening to a pastor speak and he talked about when you volunteer and serve at church and surround yourself with a community of believers you begin to get into a flow of people who are on the same path and pursuit of the same Godly things as you. And it’s funny because just a few weeks ago I was chatting with the head coach for the UVA boy’s basketball team Tony Bennett at an event and he was telling me how he ac...",

If I’m being honest, I should include myself in that. Though, not everything we see on our phones is harmful. God can be glorified through sending encouraging text messages, showing love through social media, or consoling a friend on a phone call. However, our phones can also make us accessible to messages that promote hatred, evil, and fear. Given this reality, it is very important for our students to be involved in a spiritual community. I could describe my teenage years as three things: cringeworthy, even more cringeworthy, and full of growth. As painful as it might be to look back, I believe there’s an important reason that “cringeworthy” is a stereotypical description for our teenage years.

No matter what you do, or the control you try to hold tightly on to, you’re just never hitting the mark, stride, sweet spot of peace and happiness that you ‘think’ will make life better and easier. I have to confess that I feel this way, quite often. I’m a lover of control, of keeping things peaceful at all times, and keeping conflict far away and a perfectionist to my core.

He is my rock! There is not evil in Him.” Ps 92:14-15 – NTL I am grateful for the fruit bearing promise of Psalm 92 because I didn’t even get planted until middle age. I was saved on a Friday evening, April 11, 1997. I am happy to share my salvation story if you ask me. That night changed my life forever – gave me a purpose and passion that thankfully has not dimmed in over twenty years. Giving your life to Jesus at any age can dramatically affect your relationships. You begin to think differently, act differently, “want” differently. Even as a church goer there is a shift in your relationships. For almost twenty years I persevered in prayer and fellowship with women I deeply loved in a Women’s Bible Study. A time came when I could no longer stay true to my understanding of the Bible, and I left that church. I found the Point through the invitation of some friends who ...",

Then he consented.” - Matthew 3:13-15 In January 2006, I had a wild idea: I would apply to graduate school.

If you give a blessing using your private prayer language, which no one else understands, how can some outsider who has just shown up and has no idea what’s going on know when to say ‘Amen’? Your blessing might be beautiful, but you have very effectively cut that person out of it.” - 1 Corinthians 14:16-17 (MSG) I used to not be a pray-out-loud kind of girl. Saying those intimate words so loud that others can hear them seemed awkward at best, and pushy at worst. The exception of course is grace around the dinner table with family, when it’s understood to be more of a cultural experience at least for my family of Southern roots, but when I am really talking to God I’ve always felt privacy was the best method for me.

Koinonia encompasses much more than just what its definition entails. It does mean “fellowship” or “communion” and we can understand it as such in the English language, however, it means a fullness of community and essentially a participation in the body of Christ. As believers we have a bond that transcends all that separates us as humans, societal and economics backgrounds, ethnicity, race, and the like. We have a relationship with Christ where he transforms us by His sacrifice on the cross and welcomes us as sons and daughters into His glorious kingdom of light. This creates a communion that is deeper even than the blood that twin brothers would share. This is the strength of the word Koinonia. Our group environments are meant to be places where we truly live out the calling fo...",

She is highly intelligent, has always been extremely verbal with a vocabulary way beyond her age. She is affectionate and compassionate and the only person in her family who really loves their cat. How could she be autistic? I am so grateful I had my wonderful community group of women to share this news with shortly after I found out. We were studying a lesson about Ruth and Naomi.

Of course, the Pharisees didn’t miss an opportunity to be critical and complain to the disciples as to who’s dinner invitation Jesus had accepted. In the Pharisee’s opinion, Matthew and his friends, the other disreputable sinners, were scum and not worth anyone’s time, especially Jesus, but….wait! Hmmm…this situation could be an opportunity FINALLY to prove that Jesus wasn’t who he said he was. So, after complaining to the disciples, but before the disciples had a chance to make any comments or give any answers, Jesus spoke with what is recorded in Matthew 9:12 & 13b.

Why do we think like this? Unfortunately, we are all subject to comparison, but that’s why we need to constantly look to the LORD! I’m not saying that if you have a huge house and drive a nice car, you’re a sinner. There are people who are deeply rooted in material possessions. SO many people look to earthly things in order to fill a void in their heart that they can’t seem to fill. People in biblical times had this problem. It’s human nature to compare.

Recently, I got a rare glimpse “behind the veil” that covers everything that God does for us and protects us from… things that we don’t normally get to see. A plumber came to fix a leak in my garage wall. He told me to call a roofer and referred one who could come out that day. (For some reason, there seemed to be a sense of urgency inspired by God.) The roofers plugged some holes and were leaving when the older guy told the rookie to get the big ladder down – – he sent him way up the side of the house to a higher point in the wall. There was something that looked odd to him. He just wanted to check it out. The younger guy climbed way up, looked at a very small hole in the wall, pulled something out and yelled, “I found the source of the leak. But you have a bigger problem”. He reached deep into the exterior wall and pulled out a smoldering PVC drainage pipe. The clear pipe was c...",

I have to admit; this was the first time I was truly nervous about a trip. You see I’m what I like to call an extroverted introvert. I am a major introvert. Crowds make me anxious and talking to people (especially new people) is not something I excel at.

302,Hold My Hand,post,2019-09-17 12:00:00,,/blogfeed/2019/9/17/hold-my-hand,Today’s blog is written by Jonathan Hickory.,"While spending some much needed “unplugged” time with my family at the beach, my 2 year old son and I were playing in the water. He’s so little, and the waves of the Atlantic are so strong, I refuse to allow him to face the water alone. He stands with me, looking out at the wondrous waters before him, his wide eyes squinting beneath the brim of his stars and stripes themed sun hat. I hold his hand firmly, and we plant our feet in the sand together as we brace for the crashing waves together. I know that if I let him go, or if he pulled away from me, he would quickly be swept into the strong current of the water, a dangerous situation for a small child. I think about all the times in my life when I have faced the waves of life crashing into me. The times when I stood firm and held my Heavenly Father’s hand, I did not fall. Then I think to the darkest times of my life, when I pulled away from my Heavenly Father and tried to stand firm on my own. The waves quickly overtook me and I found ...",

"" (1 Corinthians 10:31 NIV) One of my favorite things about this scripture is the emphasis on all . It doesn’t say some or a few , but all . This is such a sweet reminder to all of us that God cares about even the smallest of moments during our day. As I prepare to kick off another school year, I’m often reminded of the many ways that small things matter. Students notice the high-fives given, the hugs during a rough day, and the waves they see as they board the busses in the afternoon. I used to overlook these moments, until I realized that these actions have a huge impact in the success of their daily routine. To some people, these small gestures may be insignificant. But, to the students, they make a world of difference during their day. In the same way that teachers and staff focus on doing the small things to brighten a child’s day, our Father in heaven loves to see us give that same ...",

There is sheer joy on her face when she knows I’m watching. But I also notice the anxiety she feels when she thinks I don’t see her. There have been times on the playground or playing around the house when she runs into trouble and needs my help, but panic fills her heart and worry floods over her face as she frantically searches for me before I softly remind her, “I’m right here.” I’m not a toddler anymore and I have realized hard human realities like the fading applause, the end of a season, or abandonment. These cold feelings can lead to wondering “Does anyone really see me? Do I matter? As adults, we can sometimes find ourselves demanding God’s attention, “Daddy, look at me! Do you see me ...",

(Mark 11:14) Jesus said this to a lone fig tree near the road he and his disciples were travelling. Imagining myself in the scene, I fear I would have been that impulsive disciple piping up with, ""Lord, that’s pretty harsh!” Was Jesus truly angry that a tree did not produce fruit out of season? Although Jesus was fully human, He was also fully God. God who is slow to anger. We can be certain that any frustration with this verse is due to our limited knowledge, not the nature of Jesus Christ. The details in Mark 11:12-14 lead us to better understand what Jesus was saying. Scripture says it was ""a fig tree in leaf"" and ""that he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs."" (vv. 12-13) As leaves start to unfurl on fig trees, little knobs also form. They drop from the tree prior to the figs’ fruition. These were a favorite source of food for travelers of Jesus' time. You can picture a single fig tree on the horizon full of bright...",

Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.” 2 Corinthians 12:7-10 Is there anything more countercultural than boasting about your weaknesses? I mean, who does that? Certainly not many people I know. When I reflect on my life, I can think of plenty of times I’ve boasted about something, but I’ve rarely boasted about my weaknesses. I’ve tried to stay humble, but pride is always lurking in the shadows. Pride is something I think all of us have dealt with in our lives and it was no...",

Who would’ve imagined we’d be living through a global pandemic with continuous uncertainty about the future. Definitely not me! I am a planner. I always feel better when plans are set and feel settled when I know what is coming. During this pandemic, planning has been ridiculously hard. There are so many unknowns. There are plans we had set over these past 5 months that were cancelled. Family gatherings. Celebrations. Camps. Trips.

If concerns become the track our minds ride day after day, news cycle after news cycle, it’s near impossible to shift direction. In fact, our fear and pride direct that very train of thought. In his letter to Timothy, Paul shares that people will grow increasingly unthankful in the darkest of days. Like an expert marksman, he nails what is common to all of us – forgetfulness of God’s perfect gifts. Wouldn’t you agree it’s hard to be thankful for something you don’t rememb...",

Let’s step back and remember the huge step of faith Mary took those many years ago. Most young girls at that time and in that area of the world were betrothed/engaged at around 11 or 12 years of age; and generally, to an 18-year-old who now would be able to have a job and take care of a family. In the Eastern world if you were 13 and not married, you were like what we think of as an old maid. Mary was engaged to Joseph, still living with her family. But the day the angel Gabriel appeared to her, changed her life and the world forever. Mary woke up on a typical day, perhaps doing her chores or visiting with family and friends, not even imaging what would come that day. I think of all that Luke 1 says……. all Mary heard from the angel Gabriel: 1 – You have found favor with God. 2 – You will conceive and give birth t...",

Let all that you do be done in love.” (1 Cor. 16:13-14) What is a man? In some cultures, boys go with men to the woods, bang on logs, whoop and holler, hear traditional stories, endure painful stuff, and come back men for life with all its rights, privileges, and responsibilities. Generally, not so in our culture. It seems more of a blur, like a camera that hasn’t found a sharp focus. I even wondered at times, age 30 with a wife and two small children, “Am I a man yet?” (Now I’m a recovering parent of teenagers—20 years after; and yes, I’ve long been a man.) At some point, boys want to be regarded, treated, and respected as men. In today’s culture, though, being a guy can be tough. Men are routinely dissed and kicked to the curb. Boys are “trouble” in school. Some people focus on guys through a tiny coffee straw looking for the worst behavior. There’s that, no doubt. All men are sinners; some sin b...",

They are new every morning; great is Thy faithfulness.” (Lamentations 3:22-23) “All my life You have been faithful; all my life You have been so, so good.” Whenever we sing this powerful chorus in our church, my eyes inevitably begin to fill with tears! Does this ever happen to you during worship? Lately I began to wonder, “Why does this happen, what are these tears all about?” So I asked God to help me find out. To begin with, God’s faithfulness is part of His character. He must be true to His nature, and does not change. This is why He is known in both the Old and New Testaments as a covenant keeping God. In Deuteronomy 7:9 He is “God, the faithful God, who keeps His covenant to a thousandth generation;” and in Luke 22:20, Jesus told His disciples, “This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in My blood.” Yes, God is truly and forever faithful – hallelujah! – but I found there was...",

331,The Lord is Our Peace,post,2020-04-07 13:00:00,,/blogfeed/2020/3/31/the-lord-is-our-peace,Today’s blog was written by Greg Webber.,"Scripture Reading: “I WILL BE WITH YOU.” (Judges 6:16) Billy Graham stated: “This is Peace--to be able to sleep in the storm! In Christ, we are relaxed and at peace in the midst of confusions, bewilderments, and perplexities of this life. The storm rages, but our hearts are at rest.” Scripture reminds us all of the story of Gideon and the anxiety he must have felt when God asked him to deliver the children of Israel. But the Lord spoke the words we all need to hear these words in Judges 6:16: ""I will be with you!"" With all that's happening daily, being self-employed and having employees that have been with me as long as 30 years, it is easier to invite something like worry or fear into your mindset. Some of these employees have become like family. God taught me years ago how to recognize and understand worry and fear as being incompatible with answered prayer. The enemy is a master at deceiving us all in very seductive ways. I pray we all put on the full armor of God – first thing ever...",

333,Quarantine Encouragement From a Professional,post,2020-04-21 14:00:00,,/blogfeed/2020/4/22/quarantine-encouragement-from-a-professional,This blog was written by Della Anne Gallagher.,"Scripture Reading: “I am acting with great boldness toward you; I have great pride in you; I am filled with comfort. In all our affliction, I am overflowing with joy.” (2 Corinthians 7:4) These days it seems like you can’t avoid affliction, even when forced to shelter in place. With all the news, loneliness, and even tensions inside your own home it can be hard to find the joy. It’s important to be aware, be smart, be safe, and be kind (to yourself and others). These are tough times for all, but working together (even from afar) can be a huge help to everyone. I’m not a CDC or biblical expert, but I do know that being smart, considerate, and faithful will get us through this. And feeling panic, fear, concern, anxiety, etc. is normal and okay. God gave us feelings and common sense for a reason. God is in control. But it’s how we deal with it and treat ourselves and others that is in our control. Y’all can do it! So as someone who does social distancing for a living (thanks to a few chro...",

I will be “the Light unto your feet and the Lamp unto your path.” (Psalm 119:105) A couple of days ago, my 3 year old son terrified my wife and me when he hopped on his little balance bike, locked his gaze on the horizon, and took off out of the driveway and down the street. Our 10 year old daughter and our 14 year old nephew had just left a few minutes prior on a bike ride, but they were well out of sight. My 7 months pregnant wife was in no position to run after him, and she called out to him in vain as he blazed a trail into the sunset. I was outside at the time and heard the commotion, and a split second later I was tearing through the front yard, hot on his heels—or wheels. I yelled at him to stop, some obvious desperation in my voice. But my voice fell on deaf ears as my determined little fellow only seemed to pick up speed as he rolled down the dangerous street. Thankfully, there were no cars anywhere ar...",

I’m the OG of FOMO (fear of missing out) , and I tend to look backwards in regret and also forwards in anticipation. It breeds anxiety in my life, like major anxiety, and it’s something that I dealt with even as a child. I can’t say I’ve eliminated any of it, or some magic stardust floated down and *poof* I’m cured, but this whole thing has caused me to slow my roll. Gratitude like every single day. Even the days that feel like everything is combusting. I love this sacred space we’ve created as a family and that’s growing in me these past 8 weeks. Its something that has been missing in me for quite awhile, and I’m finding it again. This time has gone by so quickly, and it’s definitely not ending super fast...but life must move forward.

He has no limits; He is unable to be fully known; He is an infinite mystery. Earlier this year I suffered a serious injury that had me bedridden for weeks. I don’t know how I got hurt. The doctors don’t know how I got hurt. How can I literally not be able to stand up or drive or shower and no one know the cause?! Here’s the truth: God knows me full well. While the chiropractor, my parents and friends, and myself try to understand, God doesn’t try. He made me and He is intimately familiar with me. He knows exactly what went wrong and how it happened, and He knows exactly what I need to heal. While I am limited in my knowing, God is not. And this truth creates peace in my heart. I do not know myself fully nor can I, but I do know the one who knows me fully and He is good and He is trustworthy. So, in my...",

I wrote a schedule for our days: up and showered by 9, bible study together at the dining room table, English or Algebra work, exercise outside, and chores. There would be a family lunch, a break time, followed by more school. We would make dinner together, wind down for the evening, and go to bed by 10. I threw the schedule away by the second day.

He shielded him and cared for him; he guarded him as the apple of his eye.” Deuteronomy 32:10 I made my choice for college on “Decision Day”, the last day possible to make the decision. One month after graduating from college, I accepted an assistantship for graduate school just as I was leaving for vacation. More recently, I accepted a contract for my current job in Charlottesville on the Fourth of July in 2017, without even visiting, and just about a month before the position was set to start. Prior to all of these monumental decisions, and many smaller ones in between, I wondered if I was making the right choice because I had other carefully thought out plans. That is the problem, though, when I look at my journey through this perspective- it isn’t really about my plans. Time and time again, God was directing and protecting me while I took my sweet time getting to where I am today- geographically and s...",

Everything was getting ready to shift into high gear, and every moment counted as Jesus knew exactly when He would be arrested… This was a KAIROS moment of all KAIROS moments, and the clock was counting down. Jesus prayed a very specific intercessory prayer in some of His last moments of “freedom”. VERY specific, because Jesus was and is ALWAYS very specific. And the final part of His penultimate “private” intercessory prayer — the long one before His final brief one in the Garden — before His arrest — was for US. (The first time I ever read John 17, as a new Christian over 45 years ago; I marveled, “Wow, Jesus prayed this for Me!” Because that’s what John 17:20 says… For ME!) YOU and ME. TODAY. RIGHT NOW.

He always does that, doesn't He? The foundation is Jesus. Luke 6:46-49 and Matthew 7:24-27 explain the difference between just hearing His Words and hearing and acting upon them.

I need to hear this just now and at many other times. I know the two great commandments of the Law, the commandments to love God with all I have and am and to love my neighbor as myself. And I know that the standard goes even higher in the ""new commandment"" Jesus gives us: that I am to love my fellow Christians, who are in Christ with me and know God, not just as I love myself, but as Jesus loves them. And I truly long to love God--and my brothers and sisters in Christ--that way. I can hear these great commandments and wonder how I may get a grip on such a high standard for my own life. Perhaps I doubt that it is possible. Of course, I know I can never equal the love of Jesus himself! And He is not asking me to do the impossible, he who knows my limitations better than I know them. But clearly by stating these commandments in the way he does, Jesus wants and calls me to aspire greatly, to aim very high indeed. How ca...",

Simply put, we were not allowed to be negative! When mom went on her “being positive” rant, we glued our mouths shut, focused our eyes on her and took our tough love. After our lecture we said “Yes ma’am” and then retreated to our rooms. You bet there was eye rolling and sticking our tongues out when shecouldn’t see us!

We haven’t seen our children and grandchildren in a long time.” I completely understand her fear - this disease can be deadly. So we turn to God and what He says. We try to live our lives trusting Him especially in the hard situations in our lives. He says repeatedly “ Do not fear, be anxious for nothing .” We want to live our lives obeying what He says and trusting Him rather than living in fear. There needs to be a balance between just trusting that we will not get the virus and, therefore, living without any caution (going anyplace we want, being with many people) or going the opposite way and giving into fear that ...",

The problem was not that it was too heavy. No, this poor little guy was flimsy as could be. So much so, you could barely lift it. And the accompanying bed was not much better - I don’t know where it came from, but I am pretty sure it was free. The wooden slats that held up the box springs tended to fall out during the night. One thing was made clear; it was time for a new bed! And not surprisingly, once I made that exchange, both my sleep and my back improved. Sometimes our spiritual lives are a lot like that sad mattress. They may look good on the surface (as my bed did when covered with a bedspread and pillows), but “flimsy” is a more accurate description when we take a closer look. When things get tough, our natural tendency is to give up, run away, hide, pretend, or point ...",

It can be hard to believe Jesus’ declaration when you feel more like a smoking match. The truth is, regardless of how you feel, His plan for you has not changed. You are actually positioned to be stoked by His Spirit. Keep in mind the Lord is not disappointed when you feel burned out. He knows we can grow weary, discouraged, and disheartened. Life spins us through cycles of wins and losses, joy and grief, and every day can hold innumerable highs and lows. He has lived here just like us and His soul was put to the test as well. Perhaps this is one reason why He tells us, “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."" (Matthew 11:28 NIV) He understands. The prophet...",

I read somewhere that almost half of Americans make New Year’s resolutions but only 8% stick to their goals. I am definitely not in that 8% successful group! My resolve to be a goal-oriented person starts strongly at 6 a.m. but by 5 p.m. I can have a completely different attitude. For years I gave up making formal resolutions because adhering to them was so tough. It was discouraging to set a goal and miss the mark time and time again. “Maybe I’m not setting the right goals,” I eventually concluded. “Maybe there’s a better way to help my growth and development. What does God think about all of this?” I wondered. We’re far enough into 2021 to see it will require a lot of flexibility to function well.

Church has always been a part of my life, and I’ve spent 50 years attending church, serving, teaching, and volunteering. However, I recently began feeling that God was leading me to make a change. My church family and activities were things that I had always enjoyed, but now I seemed to be on a quest for something deeper and truer to the real message of Jesus. I considered making that change and searching for more. So I began praying for direction and set out on my journey. Part of my plan was to visit a few local churches. A friend told me about the Point, and the first Sunday I attended just happened to be a celebration of the Point’s 10th anniversary!

I start my morning prayer with this verse every day. It’s a verse that I relate to and a reminder that God is the one in control but it’s up to me to choose whether I’m grateful and/or joyful or whether I respond in a different way. This is a comfortable verse for me because I am grateful for each day and life is generally pretty good. It’s easy to be grateful and joyful when life is pretty good. However, I recognize that other people have circumstances in their lives that make this verse more challenging in terms of “rejoicing and being glad in it”. Trials present themselves and life starts to feel less gratifying and less joyful. How do we respond?

My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.” Psalm 121:1-2 ESV The other day I was texting with a fellow new mom friend about how chaotic and busy the season of new motherhood felt. We chatted about our shared season of having little ones, a season where you often don’t have a second to check-in on yourself and self-care takes the form of a 5-minute shower twice a week. We echoed each other’s sentiment of being in survival mode. And then these words were laid on my heart: “God is at work in my hard seasons.” I have seen the mantra “I can do hard things” proclaimed a lot, especially in the past year. There are many days where I rephrase this mantra into “I have no choice but to do hard things”, but that isn’t the whole truth.

It’s one more gift from Him before my day is over. Sunsets are beautiful but they are not created equal. Have you ever seen a sunset after a storm? They have some of the most stunning colors I have ever seen. I love a good storm too! Sitting in the living room listening to the rain and thunder while watching the lightning can be relaxing. I know I am weird in saying this but...I even like it when the power goes out. With no power you have no choice but to sit and pay attention to what is going on around you. I love it!

Perhaps you didn’t receive the answer you desired, or maybe just didn’t know how to pray or what to say to God in a particular situation, or you may have felt too emotional or sad to even find the energy to pray. Our church family has recently experienced a terrible tragedy in the loss of one of our dear young people, and it has been deeply felt by so many of us. But there is encouragement and truth to be found in God’s Word, and I’d like to share some of that encouragement with you. No sincere, heartfelt prayer from a Christian is ever wasted.

Psalm 23:1 Most of my business career, I was in the relentless pursuit of “want”. Whether it was the want of money, status, or some milestone of success, my life was oriented toward achievement. Every morning, I woke up and aligned my calendar with my wants. At the end of the day, I would look back and ask, “Did I make progress, am I any closer to achieving what I want?” Whether I checked everything off my list that day or not, I was still feeling dissatisfied– I didn’t have the time to do everything. In my mind, if I could reach the next level, I could be content, slow down, and enjoy the process. However, as my career progressed and I started to achieve some of my wants, I was becoming less satisfied, less content. To offset the discontentment, I would speed up and push harder, climb faster.

Rachel being buried near the road to Bethlehem. Ruth gleaning in the fields and meeting Boaz. David shepherding his sheep and being anointed King too. My heart raced a bit as our bus stopped at a checkpoint on the West Bank. Would we be welcome? Mary and Joseph had anxiously looked for welcome in this city.

And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.” (Isaiah 9:6) I’m convinced God enjoys naming things. From the beginning of the Bible, we read God named humankind His image-bearers. Throughout scripture, He repeatedly renamed people to mirror their character and purpose. Names are a big deal to God. Considering God inspired the titles reflective of His one and only Son’s nature, we are wise to pay attention to them. So in this chaotic world, what does it mean that Jesus is the Prince of Peace? It reveals we are incapable of creating our own peace. Jesus as the Prince of Peace implies that peace belongs to him and it’s his alone to bestow.

He begged for his own Superman cape – and finally my mother took an old bath towel, drew a giant “S” on it, and tied it around his neck. Moments later, as she was washing dishes, she spotted my brother “flying” past the kitchen window in a rapid descent to the ground, from the roof – his “cape” barely flapping in the breeze! It must have made perfect sense to him: he loved Superman. And, as the child that he was, he put all his faith in that cape – believing it would let him fly.

One thing that has always been a constant in my life, and has brought me great comfort and strength, is the power of prayer. Prayer is such a crucial part of our spiritual formation and it has the ability to transform our lives in immeasurable ways. When we pray, we are able to connect with God and seek His guidance and wisdom. James 1:5 tells us, ""If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you."" How amazing is that? God is always ready and willing to give us the wisdom and guidance we need, we just have to ask. Prayer is also a way for us to offer up our praise and thanksgiving to God. In Psalm 34:1, it says, ""I will extol the Lord at all times; his praise will always be on my lips."" When we offer up our praise to God, it helps to shift our focus from our own problems and ont...",

We see this exemplified in Jesus’ life. Prayer was central in Jesus’ life with God, second to none. He made time for it and often stayed up all night praying. I find it fascinating as well that of all the things the disciples could ask Jesus to teach them to do, he was asked to teach them to pray (Luke 11:1)!

But regardless of when or where you accepted Christ, or whether you have been baptized before, we want to encourage you to consider taking this important step of going public with your faith through baptism. Baptism is an outward expression of an inward decision to follow Jesus Christ. It is a powerful symbol of new beginnings, and it marks the start of a journey of growing closer to God and becoming more like Him. In baptism, we publicly proclaim our faith in Jesus and the change He has made in our lives. The Bible is clear about the importance of baptism. In Matthew 28:19, Jesus commands his followers to baptize others in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and in Acts 22:16, the Apostle Paul is told by Ananias ""And now why do you wait?

What I know for certain is that I was invited to meet with her in a weekly small group to pray and read 1 John. This spiritual mother led me to the Word that ultimately renewed my broken mind. That is the power of confession in Christian community. Since then, I have learned to keep a short account with God through daily confession in prayer, and if necessary, in Christian community for support. Like Adam and Eve, we have the freedom to hide our sin and our weaknesses. However, we also have the freedom to confess, bringing our struggles into the healing light of Christ.

It implies that someone is “to have and to hold” a thing. Sound familiar? In a traditional marriage ceremony, each person echoes a vow to have and to hold one another as if they are one entity. Dear believer in Jesus Christ, God has forgiven you. He has made peace with you through Christ so He can have you and hold you. As your Heavenly Father, He has vowed Himself to you throughout scripture. Christ will never leave those who entrust their lives to Him (John 14:16, Matthew 28:20).

Aside from what words might escape your lips, typically the next thought is to apply ice to reduce swelling. Trauma produces inflammation and if you control inflammation, you control the degree of damage. Following that train of thought, how do you nurse a wounded, inflamed heart? The Lord Jesus tells us to apply forgiveness. Forgiveness is often more than a ""one and done"" kind of decision. It is a willful choice, often repeated, to not pay back the pain someone has caused you. After that initial choice to forgive, trusting God to deal with your offender, how do you stop the residual anger and bitterness from engulfing your heart? We find a solution in the parable of the unforgiving servant. Jesus said, ""Then the master of that servant had compassion, released him, and forgave him the loan.""

If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.” (James 2:14-17) Daily I see a neighbor helping others: bringing a meal to an elderly shut-in, assisting a single mom with her responsibilities, lending a hand with yard work, and in general, being an exceptional neighbor. He is a beautiful influence and he is not a Christian. A person does not need the Holy Spirit to make a difference.

(Mark 11:14) Jesus said this to a lone fig tree near the road he and his disciples were travelling. Imagining myself in the scene, I fear I would have been that impulsive disciple piping up with, ""Lord, that’s pretty harsh!” Was Jesus truly angry that a tree did not produce fruit out of season? Although Jesus was fully human, He was also fully God. God who is slow to anger. We can be certain that any frustration with this verse is due to our limited knowledge, not the nature of Jesus Christ. The details in Mark 11:12-14 lead us to better understand what Jesus was saying. Scripture says it was ""a fig tree in leaf"" and ""that he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs."" (vv. 12-13) As leaves start to unfurl on fig trees, little knobs also form. They drop from the tree prior to the figs’ fruition. These were a favorite source of food for travelers of Jesus' time. You can picture a single fig tree on the horizon full of bright...",

Now, imagine a teen equally pure hearted and acutely sensitive to sin and evil. Likely, feeling misunderstood, disconnected, and lonely would be a regular experience. As an exceptionally unique person, it makes sense to me that Jesus may have been well acquainted with loneliness even as a child. Scripture testifies that as an adult Jesus experienced times of incredible loneliness. “He was hated and rejected; his life was filled with sorrow and terrible suffering.” (Isaiah 53:3 CEV) For instance, Jesus spent 40 days isolated in the desert battling Satan’s temptations.

REACH Serve Day is an opportunity for us to put this calling into action by serving our local community and sharing the love of God in practical ways. Here are a few reasons why you should get involved in REACH Serve Day: We are called to love our neighbors. In Mark 12:31, Jesus commands us to ""love your neighbor as yourself."" This means that we are called to show love and kindness to those around us, regardless of their background or circumstances. REACH Serve Day provides a tangible way to love our neighbors by meeting practical needs and building relationships with those we serve. Serving others is a way to show our faith. James 2:14-17 reminds us that faith without action is dead. When we serve others, we are demonstrating our faith in a tangible way, showing others the love of Christ through our actions.

Child dedication is a public declaration of a parent's commitment to raising their child in the love and knowledge of Jesus Christ, with the support and guidance of a community of believers. In the Bible, we see many examples of parents bringing their children to Jesus for blessing and prayer, such as when Jesus said, ""Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these"" (Matthew 19:14). Similarly, child dedication is a way for parents to present their child before God and ask for His blessing and guidance as they navigate the joys and challenges of parenting. In addition to seeking God's blessing, child dedication also serves as an opportunity for parents to publicly commit to raising their child in a community of believers. This is imp...",

His perspective was not on the threat of death, but the sovereignty of God.

By the time we read Daniel 6, Daniel was over eighty years old and had a well-established lifestyle of praying three times a day (Daniel 6:10). Whatever Daniel prayed during this time, I am convinced his prayer life was driven by devotion to God, not answers from God. By choosing to please God, Daniel’s devotion built integrity, which in turn created habits that opened a window to his Heavenly Father. “Then the other administrators and high officers began searching for some fault in the way Daniel was handling government affairs, but they couldn’t find anything to criticize or condemn.

God responded to Daniel's faith-filled, scripture-soaked prayer with the message: ""...you are greatly loved."" (Dan. 9:23 ESV) ""...you are very precious to God."" (Dan. 9:23 NLT) ""...you are of great value in God's sight."" (Dan. 9:23 NET) Get the gist? When we pray trusting God's character with minds full of His very words, it is as if we are speaking heaven’s language. But why would this delight God? One reason is that God elevates His character and His Word above everything else. "" I bow down toward your holy temple and give thanks to your name for your steadfast love and yo...",

He approached the Ancient of Days and was escorted before him. He was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, so that those of every people, nation, and language should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will not be destroyed.” (Daniel 7:13-14) Reading : Daniel Chapter 7 begins like a nightmare. Terrorizing beasts rising from the sea is not exactly the stuff that inspires devotionals. But Daniel’s terrifying vision is the perfect pitch-black backdrop to display Christ’s glorious appearance. Today God’s enemy comes to “wear out the saints of the Most High.” (Daniel 7:25) Although we cannot fathom this persecution before Christ’s return, you have met darkness designed to wear you out.

This person’s mindset and situation had grown to such a degree that I no longer believed change was possible with our help. Heartbroken, I surrendered to the reality that this was out of our control. We continued to pray, yet I could not shake the unction to fast and pray. The idea seemed to repeatedly float to the surface of my thoughts. “Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen: to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke?” (Isaiah 58:6) My loved one’s freedom and inner healing were my heart’s constant cry.

Jesus walked, talked, and lived wisdom because of his relationship with his Heavenly Father. Likewise, you can walk, talk, and live wisely if you are in relationship with Jesus Christ. As a young believer, I had an a-ha moment when a Christian friend revealed that when deciding she asks herself, “What is wise?” In other words, it is wise to first consider not what popculture or your neighbor may suggest, but what Jesus would do in your situation. Through the gospels we see Jesus interacting with people. We read His parables, and about His perspectives and practices. We also find He consistently referred people back to God’s Word. He did this because God’s wisdom for humanity is revealed through scripture and its precepts, through Jesus “the Word made flesh.” (John 1:14) “Oh, the depth of the riches… of the wisdom… of God!” (Romans 11:33) When we spend time i...",

Scripture implies your leading others to Christ is intended to be a natural extension of your relationship with Him rather than a duty. Take, for instance, Lois and Eunice. “I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also.” (2 Timothy 1:5) When Paul wrote these words from a dank prison cell, he was not referring to Timothy’s family traditions.

I can do all this through him who gives me strength."" —Philippians 4:11-13 (NIV) Biblical Context: Paul’s letter to the Philippians was written from a place of personal hardship—imprisonment. Yet, Paul speaks of contentment not based on his external circumstances but through his deep reliance on Christ. Paul contrasts worldly success and material wealth with the peace that comes from trusting in God's provision. His contentment was a result of knowing that his life, purpose, and well-being were in God’s hands, not dependent on his achievements or comfort. Devotional: In our culture, we often equate success with contentment. We pursue career advancement, financial security, and personal accomplishments, believing that we will finally feel at peace once we reach certain milestones. But more often than not, after achieving these goals, the sense of satisfaction is fleeting, and we find ourselves chasing the next achiev...",

Always work enthusiastically for the Lord, for you know that nothing you do for the Lord is ever useless” (1 Corinthians 15:58 NLT) Reading : What lights you up? What makes you feel enthusiastic? The word enthusiasm comes from two Greek words that mean “in” and “God.” Quite literally, the word means “full of God!” Zeal. Eager. Whole-heartedness. In God, enthusiasm for what is good and right and true (2 Chronicles 31:20) is a fruit of His sanctifying work in your life. You have been set apart. “… that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.” (1 Peter 2:9) God, who never sleeps nor slumbers, is constantly shaping His children. “…for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.” (Philippians 2:13) The Holy Spirit, the Counselor, the Spirit of truth sanctifies you.

They are precious in God’s sight and my own. Magnifying what God says fuels our hope – my children’s and my own. Christian hope is the confident expectation that God is faithful to fulfill what He has started. Understand that hope is not ordinary. It is not happy optimism. Hope is how Jesus saw people, circumstances, and the future. Jesus still views us through a lens of hope knowing who we are created to be in union with the Father.

Standing next to a mighty river like the Yellowstone or the lesser known Rivanna River near my home, I could never change their courses. However, whether a man made damn or a beaver’s, a blockage could change how I experience the river. The same is true for the spiritual blessings that flow from God to His children. Gifts like hope, joy, and peace are continually available for Christ’s followers, but there can be blessing blockers. Their names are unending but typically they share the middle name “unbelief” and end with the surname “sin.” Every name of Jesus eradicates these blessing blockers. “Prince of Peace” names the wellspring of our souls, the Source of our well-being and welfare.

Feeling overcome with anger because of a misunderstanding, misinformation, or mistreatment is not easy. Whether valid or not, unchecked anger is destructive. If left ungoverned, you can count on one thing in this broken world – more broken things, including broken relationships. Freedom from emotional bondage such as anger is possible. God desires to bring peace where there has been sin. “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding…” (Proverbs 3:5) Scripture calls us to replace our natural response of anger with forgiveness.

So don’t be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is.” (Ephesians 5:15-17) Reading : “Uses time wisely.” That is not exactly the testimony of my report cards. Seated next to a window, the curiosities that drew my attention as an elementary student regularly won. Who decides what is a wise use of time anyway? Authority wins here – teachers, bosses, toddlers. I joke with the latter, but the demands of life are a reality. When we answer who or what is our authority, we gain a better understanding of how to use time. Christians believe God created the concept of time for His creation (Genesis 1:14-19). He is the authority of time. It is naïve to think we can master it. Truly, only our thoughts and actions are the pieces we control. With God’s authority in mind the New Testament emphasizes “making the best use of the time.” (Eph. 5:16,...",

Every family has someone they wish were still here. We are irrevocably changed when the people we love, who loved us, pass into eternity. I have found that “holding firm to the word of life” (Philippians 2:16) helps me to live in our Father’s world where death is a thief. “Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? praise him, my salvation and my God.” (Psalm 42:11) David, who was a shepherd, paints a vivid p...",

For whatever the Father does, the Son likewise does these things.’” (John 5:19) Jesus made it clear that not only is He equal to God in authority, but He has power over life and death including eternal judgement (John 5:17-24). Jesus is God. In his humility He understood his unique role in redeeming humanity (Philippians 2:5-8).

Now your imagination is on track to consider Nicodemus the expert Torah teacher of his time (John 3:1). With sincere spiritual hunger Nicodemus lived an exemplary life and became highly influential. He thought he had eternal life in the bag until the One who inspired scripture turned his theology upside down. Like many people Nicodemus assumed eternal salvation depended on him. He was wrong. Salvation is a gift we receive. When we move from knowing about Jesus to trusting in Him rather than in ourselves, we are saved. “For you are saved by grace through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God’s gift—not from works, so that no one can boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9) Jesus lovingly taught Nicodemus, “Truly I tell you, unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the k...",

Let the one who desires take the water of life freely.” (Revelation 22:17) Reading : In the 100 degree heat, my daughter was headed to soccer practice with what felt like a miniature bottle of water. Worried about her, I did what every good mother does. I fussed. “Don’t worry, Mom. There’s a refill station.” Assured that she would not faint from thirst, I sent her off with that little bottle. How simple it was for her to believe that if she came to the provided source, she would have an unending supply. This is also true for those who believe and come to Christ for His Living Water, His Spirit. Thirsting throughout the Bible is a picture of our need to be in relationship with God. He placed eternity - a spiritual craving - in every person’s heart so that we would seek to know Him (Ecclesiastes 3:11).

Like the blind beggar in John 9 you may have been born with an exceptional challenge or perhaps one has come about. Sin is often at the root of our challenges, but in this man’s case, Jesus made it clear that his blindness was divinely purposed (John 9:3). “After he said these things he spit on the ground, made some mud from the saliva, and spread the mud on his eyes. ‘Go,’ he told him, ‘wash in the pool of Siloam’ (which means “Sent”).

Although Paul is speaking to a body of believers in Philippians 2:12, he is expecting each person to prioritize their relationship with God. Paul writes in the very next verse, “For it is God who is working in you both to will and to work according to his good purpose.” (Philippians 2:13) Growing more sensitive to Christ in us to the point of obedience is the purpose of discipleship. It is why God is at work in you. Trusting Christ for the gift of salvation is a glorious miracle, yet being a disciple of Jesus is another miraculous feat altogether, because it depends upon our participation.

I had given her a simple gift, an expression of my compassion toward her. I had picked up her room. As we sat side by side, it was a delight to hear my name attached to her joy. Perhaps my full heart is a glimpse into how our Heavenly Father responds to our praise. Certainly, it is not a one-sided exchange. I imagine the Lord experiences something like you and I do when a loved one genuinely praises us. We are created in His image after all.

But this is not simply history, this is a glimpse of what is possible in a spiritual sense for all disciples of Christ.

Certainly, life will continue to move along if we do not pray, but we will miss much of the spiritual treasure and relationship Christ has given us.

Or as skinny preteens, all knees and elbows, struggling to keep their balance while heaving heavy nets overboard. Fishing on the Sea of Galilee was a part of their daily lives and became second nature to them. But God gives His children something better than a second nature. He gives all who place their lives in His hands a new nature (Ephesians 4:24, 2 Corinthians 5:17).

Perhaps unjust circumstances? In 2 Kings 4:1-7, we meet a widow who knew that kind of desperation. Her husband had died leaving her with debt she could not repay. This woman was facing poverty and likely the loss of her two sons as payment to a creditor. This harsh reality was the result of a broken society. The kings had failed their sacred responsibilities, and the people were far from God. Moral callousness and destructive practices were the norm. But even in a corrupt society, God saw the widow. He sent His servant Elisha to intervene. And with the kind of energy desperation creates, she cried to Elisha for help. Elisha was a spiritual leader who had concern for individuals and ministered to families (1 Kings 17:8-24). Yet,...",

This is one of the gifts of teaching at a Christian school. Those holy interruptions where creation points straight to the Creator. We were talking about how God designed shells for a specific purpose. As I watched little hands turn those shells over, I could not help but point out that If God is that intentional about mollusks, how much more intentional is He with people He formed in His image? Granted, it is a big leap from shellfish to children, but it gave me the perfect moment to share one of my favorite reminders of who we are in Christ. Paul wrote, “For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.” (Ephesians 2:10) Each one of us is uniquely created to bring about God’s goodness to our generation.

Let each one take care how he builds upon it. For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.” (1 Corinthians 3:10-11) Reading : “The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me to bring good news to the poor, he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn; to grant to those who mourn in Zion— to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit…” (Isaiah 61:1-3) Seven centuries after Isaiah penned this prophecy, Jesus sat in the synagogue of his hometown, opened the scroll of Isaiah, and declared these ve...",

Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.” (James 4:7-8) Reading: Sin is something like spiritual trash. Unattended it attracts flies. This is also true spiritually. Our rebellion creates an opening for negative spiritual influences. In fact, James tells us that sin “brings forth death.” (James 1:15) When we intentionally and daily place ourselves under God’s authority, we live according to His divine viewpoint rather than our own. Then, the abundant life that Jesus promises increasingly becomes our experience (John 10:10). It is life lived through a deep and meaningful relationship with God. Before James tells his readers to “submit to God,” he points out how these Christians were living self-reliant lives. Enticed by selfish desires they were easily deceived and experiencing turmoil.

If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.” (John 10:9-10) Reading : Have you ever had to explain how to use a door? It sounds strange, right? Doors are typically self-explanatory. They serve a clear and obvious purpose - leaving and entering. There is a door that beckons all to leave more than just a space. There is a door that leads to a more profound relationship than any other. Twice in the Gospel of John Jesus said, “I am the door.” (John 10:7-10) With that simple illustration Jesus invites us into something life changing. What is it that Jesus calls every person to leave? Perhaps it is not simply a way out, but a way in. His life is the way in to living the fullest life possible, a life lived interacting with God. “Come near to God and he will come near to you.” (James 4:8) We all have stories of leaving and ...",

For the bread of God is the One who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.’” (John 6:32-33) Reading : We are experts in stuffing ourselves. Favorite foods satisfy our bodies. Media satiates our souls. News stimulates our minds. The illustrations are endless. But these fillers are often a brief attempt to distract ourselves from spiritual hunger. “’I am the bread of life,’ Jesus told them. ‘No one who comes to me will ever be hungry, and no one who believes in me will ever be thirsty again.’” (John 6:35) Jesus was speaking to a crowd who had seen His divine power.

At every mention of this woman, she appears at the feet of Jesus (Luke 10:39, John 11:32; 12:3). Her name is Mary of Bethany. Whether Mary is listening, grieving, or worshiping, she is always near Christ. In John 11, Lazarus, who is Mary’s brother and a close friend of Jesus, is battling for his life. Mary sent word to Jesus, trusting that He would save her brother. He healed everyone who sought Him! But to her utter heartbreak, Jesus did not come. Lazarus was buried in his tomb. Four days later Mary learned that Jesus had finally arrived on the scene. She came to Him, fell at His feet, and poured out her heart, affirming what she believed .

It was a bustling weekend at Costco. Shopping carts maneuvered the tight lanes between the clothing tables. At the time, I was focused on the latest activewear, while Thin Mint Bites were calling my name. Then I heard it. “Kristin.” My mom’s voice. I could not see where she was, but the moment I heard her, my attention shifted. I did not need to see her to know it was my mom. She was somewhere in the distance. Her voice small and indistinct to my neighbors, but unmistakable to me. Why? Because I am her child. I followed the impression the sound of her voice made, weaving through shoppers and squeezing past the sweater table until I saw her. She was standing still, her happy eyes fixed on me.

A meal in honor of Jesus, the One who just days before called Lazarus, who was dead and buried, back to life. The energy around the table is buzzing with gratitude, awe, and expectation. And then silence. Perhaps it is the scent that catches your attention or maybe the soft sound of movement nearby. You glance up from your plate and see Mary, eyes brimming with tears, as she pours an expensive, fragrant perfume over Jesus’ feet. She kneels low, and with her own long hair, gently wipes them dry.

By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.” (John 13:34–35) Reading : A simple scroll through social media reveals a lot of what we love: our families, food, puppies, and vacations. Heart emojis and “#love” are everywhere online but meet someone face to face, who is hard to love, and suddenly our virtue can be rather lacking. But Jesus was not vague. During one of His final conversations with the disciples before the cross, He reiterated the Old Testament command to “…love your neighbor as yourself.” (Leviticus 19:18) Yet the way He worded it was radical. “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you,…” (John 13:34) “As I have loved you,…” Jesus had just washed their grungy feet. And let us not forget that Judas was still at the table when he said this.

Have you been there too? We know that there is something to putting our stuff in its proper place that instantly brings peace. The same is true for thoughts that run amuck, tangling our emotions. That is when you need to put your soul to rest, tucked safely into your Lord’s presence - its rightful place. David reminded himself (and us), “Rest in God alone, my soul, for my hope comes from him.” (Psalm 62:5) David wrote this while he and his exhausted people fled for their lives (see 2 Samuel 17:29). Instead of spiraling into anxiety, he chose to direct his mind and heart to rest in God, reliant on His faithful care. Like a sword resting in its sheath, David placed his soul where it belonged.

That evening, highlighted only by the hallway light, our speech delayed daughter began to sing with me - a song, a definite message, I had sung to her from her very beginning. “Jesus Loves Me.” My words had become her own. In that moment, I felt so much joy! Lest you think I’m tooting my own horn, I also recall hearing from another child in a heated discussion something much harder.

Thankfully, I was placed on a team with experienced teachers who took me in and showed me how it’s done. That’s the story you’ll hear from most impactful teachers. The most valuable lessons didn’t come through theory and knowledge, but from mentorship, modeling, and life on life experience. This is exactly the way Jesus calls us to grow as His disciples.

Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.

And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” (Matthew 28:19-20) Reading : “My friend asked Jesus into her heart today!” I can still see my kindergartener with her Dora backpack parachuting over her shoulders. Climbing into our minivan one hot pink Converse at a time, she announced her news. “I told her about Jesus at lunch and asked if she wanted Jesus to live in her heart too.” They prayed with peanut butter jelly sandwiches in their hands. For the life of me, I will never get over this. The ease. The simplicity. The pure-hearted wonder of it all. But here’s the thing - it didn’t happen in a vacuum. She had been discipled. Jesus commands us to “make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). That word cause may be helpful when considering the Lord’s mandate to make disciples. The Greek word fo...",

563,A Song in the Night,post,2025-09-24 19:03:16,,/blogfeed/2025/9/24/a-song-in-the-night,A blog by Kristin Fields,"Scripture “By day the Lord commands his steadfast love, and at night his song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life.” (Psalm 42:8) Reading I recently came across the lines of a deeply honest worship song. It was written by a worship leader who longed for God. His season of life felt pitch-black like midnight – a cloudy, starless midnight. There was no sign of the joy that once marked his life. Rather than shouts of gladness and songs of praise, questions echoed through his mind, “Why am I discouraged? Why is my heart so sad?” (Psalm 42:5) He vulnerably confessed the torment of a constant taunt in his thought life. “Where is your God?” (Psalm 42:10) The weight of oppression and the turmoil within left him feeling forgotten, unseen, overwhelmed. Have you ever felt that way? Like breakers and waves of sorrow crash into your soul, only to retreat and creep in again with relentless rhythm. You are not the only one. Seasons of wrestling between faith and despair occur in every believer’...",

As I read Isaiah 9, verse 2 captures my attention this Christmas season. Some of us are making preparations to celebrate Christmas, like putting up a Christmas tree, hanging lights and decorations, attending parties and festive gatherings, and shopping for gifts. However, there are other people who are grieving and struggling to find joy. The Christmas season can feel dark and lonely to many people, for many different reasons. I think of my dear friend, Wendy, who suddenly lost her husband, Gus, in November due to a sudden heart attack. Wendy and her 17 year old son are deeply grieving the loss of their husband and father as they experience their first Christmas without him. Gus was a man who loved Jesus and lived to serve God by doing good deeds for others. He was a self-employed carpenter (ironic, I know) who never turned a profit because he only charged...",

The start of this year was no exception. I found myself reading Ecclesiastes chapter eleven over and over. Here we are reminded that if we don’t take steps of faith, we will be like a farmer who never sows any seeds but still expects a crop to spring up. It was as if God was telling me - it’s time to move. It’s time to be bold. It’s time to make changes. So far, so good. Then I got to the last verse of the chapter, “Remove grief and anger from your heart and put away pain from your body, because childhood and the prime of life are fleeting.” (Ecclesiastes 11:10) Now it was as if God was shining a spotlight on my soul, showing me that if I wanted to walk by faith and make an impact in the world, I had a critical step to take - it was time to heal. This began what I would call...",

569,Don't Block The Light,post,2020-01-14 23:59:00,,/blogfeed/dontblockthelight,Today’s blog was written by Jonathan Hickory.,"A few nights ago, I was reading a Berenstain Bears story with my 3-year-old son. We sat together on the bed, his eyes wide as we turned through the colorful pages. In the story that we were reading, Sister Bear was scared of “spooky shadows.” Trying to comfort his daughter, Papa Bear told her, “ Shadows happen when something blocks the light ."" As I read these words out loud to my son…it struck me, right then. The shadows in our life...the darkness we feel in our hearts—comes when we allow things to block the light. ""God is light; in him there is no darkness at all."" -1 John 1:5 God is the LIGHT that fills our souls with joy and true peace. Things like pride, lust, material things, unforgiveness, bitterness and our own evil desires can very easily block Him from fully changing our hearts. The shadows cast into our hearts as a result fill our hearts and our lives with darkness. Romans 13:12 tells us, “lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.” For God’s light protec...",

The key to delegation is understanding what delegation is, and knowing the difference between delegation and abdication. Let’s define these two words. Delegation - the process of entrusting and empowering Abdication - failure to fulfill a responsibility or duty With delegation a process and a progression are involved. Think of good delegation happening in five stages. The Five Stages of Delegation 1. I do. You cannot lead where you have not been. Jesus has never asked us to do anything that he has not first done himself. 2. I do, you watch. Invite another person or others into the process. Give the why and teach the how. Why is the most important question to answer, but how is a close second. 3. We do together . It’s at this point that many of us abdicate because we’re relieved to have it off our pl...",

To begin with I thought Christians had another language I was not aware of. I would listen as the people in this congregation would lift up beautiful prayers. I was mesmerized as the sweetest words would be spoken. I did not grow up in church or really ever hear much of any type of prayer being lifted. After hearing them I really felt like I could never utter any words out loud for others to hear. I felt my words would never be worthy in comparison. After our first year at this church and our first year living for the Lord, a little boy in the church – maybe 6 years old was diagnosed with cancer. This was a smaller church maybe 250 people. One Sunday morning they brought this little boy up front to pray over him, many people got up to surround him physically and I felt the power of that prayer like nothing I had experienced before.

The Savior—yes, the Messiah, the Lord—has been born today in Bethlehem, the city of David! And you will recognize him by this sign: You will find a baby wrapped snugly in strips of cloth, lying in a manger.” Suddenly, the angel was joined by a vast host of others—the armies of heaven—praising God and saying, “Glory to God in the highest heaven, and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased. ” (Luke 2:10-14 NLT) What news can bring great joy to all people? Only one announcement can bring exceedingly great joy to every person ever created regardless of culture and century. C.S. Lewis wrote, “The Son of God became a man to enable men to become sons of God.” God sent His Son to reconcile all people to Himself.

Now that Christmas is over, most of our Christmas trees have been or will be taken down and the ornaments put away for another year. Have you ever wondered why putting up the tree is more fun than taking it down? I have, and I’ve noticed other things as well. For instance, I always enjoy setting the table for a special dinner more than clearing it after the dinner guests have left. And packing for a family vacation is much more compelling and exciting than unpacking. Perhaps the answer lies not so much with our after-Christmas let-down than with facing what comes next – the unspecial, unspectacular return to our normal lives – day to normal day. Let’s face it, God calls us to be “Everyday Christians” for the majority of our lives, but sometimes hidden there in the ordinary is our true value, our identity, and our unique calling to a life of extraordinary faithfulness, co...",

If God’s Word tells us there is a way out, expect Him to show up and provide a way for you. At an early age, I used drugs to escape a reality that seemed impossible to live sober. I did not listen to what God’s Word said, and as a result, I found myself in a desert for the better part of ten years.
