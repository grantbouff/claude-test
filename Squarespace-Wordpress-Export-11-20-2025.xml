      <title>Power in Weakness | One Verse Blog - Day 1</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2017/10/10/power-in-weakness-one-verse-blog-day-1</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.”</em>&nbsp;-2 Corinthians 12:9-10 (ESV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ever since we were born, society has told us that weakness is bad and inferior. That said, it can be easy to fall into a pit of self-pity or self-doubt when life gets hard. It’s easy to question ourselves – whether it be our abilities, our strengths, or our weaknesses. However, Jesus’ ministry is full of individuals who were seemingly weak, inferior, or disliked. Jesus took the least of these and used them to make an eternal impact for the kingdom.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In 2 Corinthians, Paul tells us that when we are weak God can show up and blow our minds. I think we see God’s strength the most in our lives when we are weak and have to fully rely on Him. I’m talking about those moments when you have nothing left to give and have nowhere else to turn except to God for guidance, wisdom, strength, and comfort. We stop relying on our own abilities, and start relying on our great and perfect heavenly father. When we do this, when we fully rely on God, He comes through in ways we could have never imagined or seen coming.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is in these moments that we can look back and say, “Only God could have done that.” Through the mess, through the heartache, through the late nights and hard work – God showed up and outdid Himself!</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Therefore, we should boast in our weakness! Whenever I start to feel stress or worry, I know that those feelings aren’t of God and that I need to lean more into Him, His word, and His promises – this promise in 2 Corinthians! Even though I am imperfect, weak, and have my flaws – He is perfect and He works through me. When we are weak, He is powerful in and through us.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Think about a hard time of your life that caused you to feel weak, stressed, worried, or like a failure. Did God redeem that time and show up in a big way? If you’re going through that hard time right now, are you able to see it as a time to let God in and lean on Him through the hardship? Are you able to boast when you are weak so that God can reveal Himself in a big way?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer<br></strong>God, I am so thankful for who You are – that You are a perfect, powerful, loving God who always shows up even in my weakness! You make me better; You make me whole. Even though I go through hard times in this world, I trust that You are always for me and with me every step of the way. You are working out every detail in Your plan for my life and I trust in You! Help me to remember this even when life gets crazy. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br>I remember that winter’s day so vividly. I found myself sitting in awe of another one of God’s amazing sunsets. I came to the end of myself and the life I was trying so desperately to control and create on my own. It was in that moment, with pain and desperation, I surrendered every plan and desire. “Lord, it is You. All I need is you. Take it all. Whatever the cost.” I repeated this over and over. In that season of surrender, I came across this verse:<br><em>“You will show me the path of life; In Your presence is fullness of joy; At Your right hand are pleasures forever more.”</em>&nbsp;-Psalm 16:11 (ESV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Within six months of praying that prayer of surrender, I lost the three biggest things in my life that were comfortable to me. Within that painful season, I met Jesus face to face in a way I had never before. I saw my Father in heaven, strong and powerful, yet with a love in His eyes that cultivated an all-surpassing joy. My feet were steady on top of His, grabbing onto His arms as His strength and the protection of His embrace was walking me forward. My eyes were transfixed on His eyes as His love affirmed my identity. I could not see what was coming ahead of me but I felt safe with Him. In that moment of surrender, I gained a fullness of joy.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Surrender requires obedience. It requires us to let go of everything we hold close and trust Him to take us on a journey with the end goal of His glory being revealed. It has little to do with us and much to do with God. We are closest to God in our obedience and in His presence, is a fullness of joy. Obedience produces joy and joy brings forth God’s perfect gifts (James 1:17). In order to experience the fullness of how God wants to use us in this life we have been given, we must walk daily in a position of surrender.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For some of us, this means surrendering a relationship, a habit, or an area of comfort. It means exchanging our desires to be aligned with God’s desires. We are put on this earth to glorify God in all that we do. So let’s put it all in the safety of God’s hands, for the sole purpose of His glory being revealed. Through your obedience, be prepared to experience a fullness of joy and everlasting gifts.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>– How can you be obedient to the prompting of surrender and experience the fullness of joy God has for your life?<br>– Read Psalm 16:11 and Acts 2:23-33.<br>– Reflect on what Jesus did on the cross that made the way for us to experience this everlasting joy.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Dear Jesus, strip away everything I know that is comfortable to me. Let your glory be revealed through my journey. I want to experience the everlasting joy you died on the cross for me to receive. Show me the steps of obedience and give me the strength to boldly take them. Whatever the cost. In your Holy Name, Amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>1But now, thus says the&nbsp;Lord, your&nbsp;Creator, O Jacob, And He who&nbsp;formed you, O Israel, “Do not&nbsp;fear, for I have&nbsp;redeemed you; I have&nbsp;called you by name; you are&nbsp;Mine! 2&nbsp;“When you&nbsp;pass through the waters,&nbsp;I will be with you; And through the rivers, they will not overflow you. When you&nbsp;walk through the fire, you will not be scorched, Nor will the flame burn you. 3&nbsp;“For&nbsp;I am the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;your God, The Holy One of Israel, your&nbsp;Savior; -Isaiah 43:1-3 (NASB)</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Years ago I was involved in a huge multi-million dollar project. The scope of this project was extremely daunting with tons at stake for the company, both independent contractors and customers alike. There was much uncertainty that surrounded the outcome of this project, which only increased the intensity of what was at risk – millions of dollars!<br>I remember one early morning stumbling across this passage. The words seemed to rise off the page and sink into my heart. The weight of the project began to lift from my shoulders that day and onto the One who could truly carry it for me.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Just as God took care of the Israelites, I understood He would take care of me. Why? I knew that I was grafted into God’s family. I knew that when He called them by name, He also knew my name. He called me His. The same goes for you! As easy as it would have been for the waters or even the fires of this project to completely consume my mind, the opposite happened. This verse became my comfort and security. I would pass through, and not be overtaken nor burned! This would come to pass.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>What current or even past situation in your life have you felt the waters churn in an attempt to overtake you? What fire is raging so much that the flames are reaching to scorch and burn? Right now, go to your knees and lay down all that is overwhelming you at the foot of the cross. Choosing today to hand it over to God will impact your tomorrow and days to come.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Father, I thank You that You have called me by name. You are my rock, my anchor. You have redeemed me. Thank You for Your unfailing love. Help me today, Father, to live in victory through Your Son, Jesus Christ. Thank You for choosing me! Amen</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“But God demonstrates His love for us in this: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” -Romans 5:8 (NIV)</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My husband and I moved back to Virginia after living for twelve years in sunny, tropical Florida, and one of the significant differences we’ve noticed is the landscape. Even after two years, I’m still struck by the Blue Ridge Mountains when I come into Charlottesville for work. Whether they’re sharp against a clear blue sky, almost hidden by the haze of a hot day, or shrouded in fog, the mountains never bore me; I’m always delighted by them. But I wonder how many friends who have lived at the base of these mountains feel the same awe.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Romans 5:8 is a verse that reminds me of our mountains. For people who have known the Lord for a long time, the truth promised in this verse might feel so natural that we pass right by it, and fail to acknowledge how remarkable, impossible, and staggering this reality is. Christ died for us. Even before we knew Him, even as some perhaps hated Him, God loved us enough to let His son die for us.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It took me a long time and many, many prayers of believing friends before I finally came to know the Lord. I can see now that he was calling me in those years before I finally relented, when I was a decidedly un-loveable, sarcastic mocker of my Christian friends.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But the relief of His forgiveness was short-lived for me. Shame settled onto my shoulders and even though He had already forgiven me, I suddenly had a hard time forgiving myself for who I was before I knew him and for sins I struggled to get free from. Romans 5:8 was a solace to me during this time; it was one of the first verses I learned by heart. It showed me that God’s promise has nothing to do with me or my sins and everything to do with who He is. His redemption is perfect where I fail to be. His forgiveness is unlimited despite the sins I still struggle against. His love is overwhelming even when I’m duplicitous or cruel or snarky.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So I choose to be in awe of the truth of Romans 5:8 even though I’ve known the Lord for more than 13 years. I’m happy to dwell there and shake my head at the impossibility that God loves me that much. And if God could love me when I was so un-loveable, I know he loves me now.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Challenge yourself to make this verse new.&nbsp;What does it mean that while YOU were still a sinner that Christ died for you?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Lord, thank you for loving me so much.&nbsp;Even before I knew you, even before I could hope to live for you, you let your son die for me.&nbsp;I cannot fathom how big that sacrifice was.&nbsp;Let me dwell in that confidence, that I am so precious and valuable to you, and that you are so mighty and loving that you rejoice that I’m yours despite all the ways I don’t deserve it. In Jesus’ precious name, amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.” -Matthew 5:16 (NASB)</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I love the phrase, “Let your light shine.” I remember singing the song, This Little Light of Mine, when I was a child and thinking it meant I needed to tell others about Jesus, but really, it goes so much deeper. When we look at children, we see a spark; a light that shines out and just makes us smile. As the reality of this sinful world begins to make its impact, it is heart breaking to see the light dim, but the light is not gone.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The devil uses so many things to attempt to steal the light of God and make us feel like it is gone. He uses things such as harsh words from parents, teachers, and even children. For me, the devil was most successful by using my own thoughts, or should I say, the devil’s thoughts which I took as my own. I used to tell myself how I needed to be different. That I should be quieter like other girls in my class and not laugh so much. I did not realize at that very time I was rejecting the gifts God had given me and telling God He should have made me different. Instead of building on the gifts of joy and happiness, I was putting a bushel over my light and allowing the devil to blow it out.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It was not until years later when I began to realize what I had done and even many more years before I realized it was the devil working in me to hide the light of Jesus. By surrendering to God I was able to let my light shine again, but it took some time to quiet the voice of the devil. The good news is that with God’s light, the devil’s darkness cannot be present. I now live with the light of God leading my life. I do not have to work to push the devil out, I simply have to focus on God and He will overcome!</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Can you think of times when your light has been covered? How about your children – can you think of how the devil works to bring them down and keep their light from shining?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Dear Lord, You are so good and I love you so much! Come into my life Lord and shine into every part of me, leaving nothing untouched. Let all around me see your light and your love through me. Open my eyes to the gifts you have placed in my life and help me to develop my gifts to bring you glory. Thank you for never giving up on me. In Jesus’ name; amen</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” -Jeremiah 29:11 (NIV)</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I had what one might call an epiphany one morning when I was in Indiana that reminded me of another time and place. The previous July, when I was working in Colorado Springs, I was having a difficult time “feeling” God’s presence in my life. At the time it felt like God was far away and I was not doing what He had called me to do. Maybe I was lonely or simply confused about my future.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I remember feeling like a child who had lost sight of his parent in a store, looking around as if everything was strange and unfamiliar, calling out for my Father to find me. As I called out in prayer, I looked up and two large deer came up over the ridge into full view in front of my window. One of the big bucks just stood there looking at me. A feeling came over me that even though I do not always see or feel God, this was His reminder that He is always present. I may not always see Him but He is very close at hand, always right within reach. All I need to do is trust that He is there – always there –to be a guide for my life.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After we had moved to Indiana, I had forgotten that message and lost sight of God’s constant presence in my life. One morning, I was praying again for Him to show Himself to me, to remind me of the plan He has so that I can be at ease – that I am doing His will and not my own. After my prayer time, I went out to get the paper from the mailbox and as I turned around, standing less than 30 feet from me were two deer in my backyard. They were standing there just looking at me – just like the buck back in Colorado Springs. For the next few minutes we stood there looking at each other. I couldn’t believe that we had deer in our backyard, as we did not have any woods in the neighborhood.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After they moved on, it hit me – God sent me my reminder. It was nothing more than two deer in our backyard to the kids but to me it was the reminder of the lesson He taught me in Colorado Springs. He is always there. Even though He most often uses His Word – the Bible – to talk to us, He can use any method He wants. He can and will show us the way if we are patient and wait for His plan and for time. Even though we do not know His complete plan for each of us, there is a plan and He will keep building and shaping us to fulfill that great and beautiful plan.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Think about a time where you have lost sight of God and He showed you something as a reminder to let you know He is always there. Thank Him for having “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Thank you Lord for Your constant guidance and reminders. Father, may I never lose heart and forget that you are always with me. You see everything that is going on in my life and I can rest in that assurance that you know all and will help when the time is right and best for me and your glory. Amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.” -John 2:5 (ESV)</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">While Jackson was hopping to the car trying to tie his shoe, Caroline was frantically looking for her inhaler. Meanwhile, our needy cat distracted Karis from putting on her coat. Then, the frenzied cry of nearly every tardy parent rang out. “If you did what I tell you to do when I tell you to do it, we might get there on time!” Perhaps I expressed myself a smidge more like a crazed fool than a wise sage, but you know those are timeless words.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m sure Jesus’ mother sounded more admirable when she made a similar point at the wedding at Cana. “Do whatever he tells you.” Sometime later Jesus directed the servants, and their immediate compliance led to the first miracle attesting to His identity as the Son of God. The fruit of their obedience revealed Jesus as the ruler over the material world, as well as compassionate and generous in caring for people. In fact, it was after this sign that many of Jesus’ disciples believed in him (John 2:23).</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Can you imagine the astonishment of witnessing gallons of ordinary water turn into extraordinary wine? And notice Jesus spoke to servants in this passage (John 2:1-12). The Word made flesh directs His servants – those who have surrendered their lives for His will to be done. Nevertheless, what Jesus says can often cause even servants to pause. Daily we face decisions between serving ourselves and serving God. But, obedience will always be life giving in comparison to the natural consequences of ignoring Him. Ultimately, we are responsible for doing whatever He tells us.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The One who turned jars of water into wine, also calmed the roaring waves and walked on the sea as if it were glass. There’s no telling what we may forfeit when we don’t do what He says, but His glory and our ultimate good are always at stake. Today let’s respond like the wedding servants to His Word and indwelling Spirit. We may just catch a glimpse of Jesus at work in our lives like never before!</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Where do you need to see Jesus turn ordinary things into extraordinary things?<br>The quality and quantity of God’s abundant provision was in accordance with servants doing whatever Jesus told them. What is He telling you to do? God’s glory and your blessing are on the other side of obeying.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is not coincidental that “Do whatever Jesus tells you” was spoken at a celebration of a loving covenant. In fact Jesus said, “If you love me, you will keep my commandments” (John 14:15). True love for Jesus shows itself in willing obedience. Ask the Lord to show you where disobedience has a foothold. Perhaps, begin your prayer time with confession and repentance. Psalm 51 is a great model.<br><strong><br>Prayer</strong><br>Heavenly Father, thank You for being intimately involved in every detail of my life. Thank You for Your tremendous mercy and generosity. Jesus Christ, You alone are worthy to be Lord over every choice I face. Please send forth Your light and truth to direct my steps, and help me to be obedient. I love You, Jesus, and want to honor You. Amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“The Lord your God is in the midst of you, a Mighty One, a Savior [Who saves]! He will rejoice over you with joy; He will rest [in silent satisfaction]&nbsp;and&nbsp;in His love He will be silent&nbsp;and&nbsp;make no mention [of past sins, or even recall them]; He will exult over you with singing.” -Zephaniah&nbsp;3:17</em>&nbsp;<em>(Amplified Bible)</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have you ever sat in a quiet room all alone and listened? Listen…do you hear your heart beat, the sound of birds chirping, children laughing, violins of worship, a cool breeze or rustling leaves? The sound…the presence of the Almighty God, The Lord is in our midst.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Lord is all around and He is rejoicing. One year ago my family moved back to Charlottesville and though I grew up here, the months have been long and sometimes lonely as I try to find a new tribe of friends. As I read through Zephaniah&nbsp;3:17&nbsp;and Isaiah 43:1-2, I am reminded The Lord is always near, an ever present help, a comforter, a faithful friend and one who finds great delight in me, the one whom He has called by name.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Several years ago I took my first mission trip to Venezuela and then two more to Africa. Going to a foreign place, an unknown place, is well beyond my comfort zone. However, God assured me then that He is in the midst of any place He sends me. God loves to lead us to a place where we have to have complete dependence on Him – not to discourage but to give us assurance. He is who He says He is!</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Have you stopped to hear the sound of The Lord singing delight over your life? Have you slowed down, shut out all of the noise to hear His song of satisfaction, His song of love? Take a moment right where you are, close your eyes, take a deep breath and inhale songs of delight.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Father God, as we breathe and as we listen, allow us to hear your voice. Allow us to listen to the songs you sing over us. Songs of redeeming love, songs of grace, songs peace. Father may we know your presence, may we rest in your presence and may we experience an unshakable joy that is found only in You!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.” -Jeremiah 29:11 (ESV)</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I was new to the faith, I obtained a copy of the journal “Seek First” from The Point to help me learn more about God. One of the verses that stood out to me in the journal was Jeremiah 29:11. For a new believer, it’s a verse that makes you feel good when you’re in a bad situation. That verse carried me through my time of anxieties about dying and uncertainties about finances. On the surface, it seemed to mean God would give me a bright future where everything would go well and I could look forward to a lifetime of happiness, good health, and prosperity.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">However, it was not until more recently that I read the verses before and after to truly understand its meaning. Jeremiah was writing to the people of God who were exiled from Jerusalem into an enemy’s territory. Jeremiah 29:11 would surely bring comfort to those who were in that situation. But before verse 11, God asked His people to “seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the Lord on its behalf” (V. 7). The last thing that I would want to do when I am in an enemy’s territory is to pray for my enemy and wish goodness upon him. Not only that, but God said that he would fulfill the promise after 70 years. 70 years is a long time for me, and some people at that time wouldn’t even be alive in another 70 years. It is with that knowledge that I suddenly realized “the plans I have for you” are not the same as “the plans that Randy has for himself.” The plans that I have for my future might not be aligned with God’s plans for me. It was God’s plan to send His people into exile and it was God’s plan to bring them back to their homeland after 70 years of praying to Him and seeking Him with all their hearts. I need to put my plans into His hands and have God as the center of them. After all, God is in control; God provides for the birds of the air (Matthew 6:26) so surely He will provide for us because of His love for us. It is still hard for me at times, especially recently, when my plans to become healthy after I was sick for a while didn’t come into fruition right away. But it is through God’s timing and growth during the difficult trials that I get to know more about God and become closer to Him like the Jewish people did.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I was in college, I frequently prayed for a girlfriend, even though I didn’t really know who God was. I had always been single, so I figured prayer couldn’t hurt. About five long years later, I met a girl who helped me really get to know God and have a personal relationship with Him. That girl later became my wife. I never would have known that the girl that I prayed for would help me to have a true relationship with God and I am forever thankful for it. God will come up with far bigger and better plans that we can ever imagine and I am grateful to have such a good Father who is faithful to me to be the Planner of my life.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Can you think of a time in your life when God changed your plans and led you down a different path? How did you grow in your faith through God’s redirection? As you anticipate the future, how you can be flexible and open to God’s leading?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Lord God, thank you for being an awesome Father and a Provider. Thank you for Your wisdom and that You knew the plans for each of my days before I was even born. I pray that you can use my time of waiting to grow in my relationship with You. I pray for a heart of obedience and trust as I align my plans with Your plans. I am willing to let</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“He found him in a desert land, and in the howling waste of the wilderness; he encircled him, he cared for him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.”</em>(Deuteronomy 32:10 ESV)<br><em>“Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings”</em>&nbsp;(Psalm 17:8 ESV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Recently, I overheard a dad tell his daughter she was the apple of his eye. How sweet it was to see God’s Word illustrated in the flesh. Take note parents and lovebirds alike, “the apple of my eye” is no ordinary sentiment. It flows straight from the heart of God and finds form in the words of Deuteronomy 32:10. As a first mention in the Bible, “apple of His eye” is significant in establishing an unchangeable truth. The verse describes the reality of our Heavenly Father’s nearness to His children, surrounding and caring for them with unwavering focus. As adopted children of God grafted into His family through faith in His Son, we may assume the same.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In this Old Testament phrase the Hebrew word for apple refers to the pupil of an eye, most likely due to their similar shapes. It’s representative of what is most precious and jealously protected. For instance, imagine a rock flying toward your face. You would instinctively protect your eye. It’s intrinsic to who you are. With that in mind it’s interesting to note this word for apple, which refers to the pupil, can be translated as little man of the eye. Take a close look at your own pupils in the mirror and see why. You’ll find that whatever you focus on is reflected in them. As Jesus sees you, He sees a reflection of Himself. As the Father focuses on you, He sees an image of Himself, the image of Christ. As God’s child, you are the center of His unwavering, adoring focus or the apple of His eye.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflect</strong><br>Ask the Lord to help you see yourself in the center of His focus. Picture Him looking at you. You sense no fear, no condemnation, no guilt, no shame – that was all taken care of on the cross- just the most powerful sense of acceptance and overwhelming love radiating from His presence toward you. Thank Him for how He has wrapped you in His robe of righteousness.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Father God, thank you so much for who we are in your constant and compassionate sight. We ask you to please heal our perspective to perceive ourselves and others as you do. Until we see your eyes face to face, our hearts are wide open to you, Lord Jesus. In your unshakable name we pray. Amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken…”</em>(Hebrews 12:28 ESV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“God is faithful, who has called you into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.”</em>&nbsp;(1 Cor. 1:9 NIV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br>A small community close to my heart has been pounded with wave after wave of intense grief, seemingly the epicenter of loss. When I voiced this to a friend, I immediately realized the lie melting into my perspective. It is true that waves of loss or perpetual disappointments can make us feel as though we are glued flat to the center of a bull’s eye; however, that’s not the truth. The truth is that Jesus Christ alone is the epicenter of all life, even in the midst of an ocean of grief and transition. He is the giver of life. For those who call out to Him, He will calm the waves. He will have the final word. Jesus is Savior and King over every season and every form of transition and change.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Hebrews 12:28 says, “<em>Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken…”</em>&nbsp;Remember, Jesus has something magnificent in store for those who receive Him, and it is permanent. There will be no more devastating surprises, no more shattering, no more aftershocks. Although we look forward to receiving the fullness of His kingdom to come, what we have already received through faith in Jesus is also permanent. The promises of God are yes and amen for us in Christ (2 Cor. 1:20). They are firm, stable, and unmovable. The LORD’s presence, guidance, provision, protection, wisdom, comfort, and healing; all of His plans for you are unmovable even when our souls have been turned inside out. God is faithful to what He has promised. He has incredible goodness in store for you as you trust in His Kingship over your life.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflect</strong><br>In what ways has the Lord been faithful to you? Record your experiences.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What thoughts come to mind when you consider the loving nearness and goodness of God? Do they align with biblical truth?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Search for a verse that speaks to the compassion of God. Write it on several sticky notes and place them where you’ll read the verse throughout the day. Remind yourself of His past faithfulness and generous compassion toward you.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Father God, thank You for Your sovereignty over my life. Your truth is healing to my soul. I am so grateful. Help me to whole-heartedly lean into You to find peace and wholeness. I trust You. Thank You for Your unmovable presence and power in my life. In the unshakable name of Jesus Christ I pray, Amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“<em>But to all who did receive Him, He gave them the right to be children of God, to those who believe in His name…</em>” (John 1:12 HCSB)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“<em>For you are all children of light, children of the day. We are not of the night or of the darkness.</em>” (1Thess. 5:5 ESV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“<em>And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us,&nbsp;and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.</em>” (2 Cor. 1:21, 22 ESV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br>God is carefully watching over you, and not in the sense of “I’m keeping a close eye on that one,” but rather because He so loves you. He cannot take His eyes off of you.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It makes me think of how I see my kids when they are snug in their beds. In those moments, each child is incredibly beautiful to me– and not just because they’re sleeping. Our 6 year old baby girl’s round cheeks turn bright pink and her little rosebud lips slightly part like they did when she was an infant. Our 9 year old son lives full force and sleeps the same, tangled in his sheets, but at complete peace with the gentle rise and fall of his chest. Our 12 year old daughter’s fingers never rest during the day. It’s a season of painting fingernails, checking her phone, and practicing violin, but to see them still – they hold the gentle curve of God’s workmanship. I am captivated by each of my children. I believe that’s a reflection of how God sees us too. We are the center of His unwavering focus.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He has given many scriptures to convey how He perceives us – who we truly are when firmly rooted in Christ. He knew we would need to know how valuable and loved we are in His sight, especially in a season of discouragement or uncertainty.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">According to the Bible, when God looks at those who have put their faith in Jesus, He sees us wrapped in Christ’s robe of righteousness. He sees us filled, marked, and sealed by Holy Spirit. He hears Jesus’ personal intercession for us. He sees us hidden with Christ in God – chosen, holy and dearly loved. Agree with God’s infinite wisdom and choose to see yourself as a precious child of the light who cannot be separated from His unconditional love.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>When you look in the mirror, what judgments float through your mind? Your words may or may not be factual, but how do they compare to God’s revealed truth about who you are. List your view in one column and write God’s perspective in another. The above verses will get you get started. Cut the paper in half and hang God’s truth on your mirror.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Heavenly Father, thank You that I have access to You through the Holy Spirit. Thank You that I have been adopted as Your child, a joint heir with Jesus. Help me to see myself through Your lens – fearfully and wonderfully made, blameless and beyond reproach, free from any condemning charge, a personal witness to the power of Christ. Fill me with Your truth and free me from lies. In the glorious name of Jesus Christ I pray, Amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good in order to bring about this present outcome… So he comforted them [giving them encouragement and hope] and spoke [with kindness] to their hearts.”</em>&nbsp;-Genesis 50:20,21 AMP</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“And we know [with great confidence] that God [who is deeply concerned about us] causes all things to work together [as a plan] for good for those who love God, to those who are called according to His plan and purpose.”</em>&nbsp;-Romans 8:28 AMP</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“For I will be merciful toward their iniquities,&nbsp;and I will remember their sins no more.”</em><br>-Heb. 8:12 ESV</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“…as far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us.”</em>&nbsp;-Psalm 103:12 ESV</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br>When acknowledging your sin, perhaps you have experienced a nagging fear similar to that of Joseph’s brothers. They asked,&nbsp;<em>“What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him</em>&nbsp;(Genesis 50:15)?”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The brilliance of evil is that it does not have to entangle you to keep you captive. If you’ve walked away from sin, our enemy will continually try to steal your freedom by tempting you to doubt God’s forgiveness. To overcome this doubt, you must accept what the Lord has already declared regarding your position in Christ. “<em>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness</em>&nbsp;(1 John 1:9).”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is sweet relief to realize the Lord is incapable of holding a grudge. “<em>God is love</em>” and “<em>in him is no darkness at all</em>&nbsp;(1 John 4:8, 1:5).” Isaiah describes how “<em>the LORD longs to be gracious to you</em>&nbsp;(Isaiah 30:18).” When we acknowledge our wrong before Him, sin is removed as far as the east is from the west and God remembers it no more. God never shames or condemns, but rather restores His children to a correct position of peace and joy. As a believer in Christ Jesus there is no foundation of truth to fear retribution from God. That hammer smashed the nails that hung Jesus on the cross. When we take a knee to His Lordship, His wildly redemptive strategy is at work for His glory and our good. That, my friend, is called mercy. His overruling our sin is not what we deserve; it’s His game plan and our victory.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Ask the Holy Spirit to reveal sins that are blocking a fuller measure of His goodness in your life. Without judging, list every thought that comes to mind. Ask God for His power to repent and thank Him for His gift of forgiveness. Write “Forgiven” across your paper and tear it up. God keeps no record; why should you?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Thank you, Father, for Your convicting work in my life. Help me to quickly confess and repent of every dark action, word, and attitude that wants to block Your blessing. Please forgive me. Help me to receive your extreme grace and goodness. I want to be as close to You as humanly possible this side of eternity and fully embrace Your Lordship. Thank You for such a miracle. In the restorative name of Jesus Christ, I pray. Amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.”</em>&nbsp;(Galatians 5:1 ESV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”</em>(Matthew 11:28-30 ESV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“The greatest burden we have to carry in life is self. The most difficult thing we have to manage is self… In laying off your burdens, therefore, the first one you must get rid of is yourself. You must hand yourself…into the care and keeping of your God… He made you and therefore He understands you, and knows how to manage you, and you must trust Him to do it.”&nbsp;1</em>&nbsp;–Hannah Whitall Smith</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s a great way to beat your soul black and blue, trying to fulfill the lie that freedom is dependent on your behavior. This simple deception with all its striving wears us out. Jesus said, “Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” (Matthew 11:28-30)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus’ illustration is that of a young ox harnessed with the same yoke as a mature ox. The inexperienced animal did not carry the weight of the yoke. Instead, it simply learned to walk alongside the leader who carried the entire weight of the yoke on its shoulders. The only responsibility of the weaker animal was to submit and follow.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When you trust Christ as your Savior, He removes the crushing yoke of slavery and offers His yoke of Lordship. The bottom line is you are either a slave to sin or to the Lord Jesus Christ. Being yoked to sin produces death (Romans 6:21): destructive patterns, perfectionism, shame and guilt, self-sufficiency, legalism, fear, pride… The list of oppression is endless. But, when you place your faith in Jesus Christ, He then binds Himself to you. He carries your burden of guilt, setting you free from condemnation and sin’s power. The effect of being bound to Christ is ever increasing freedom for your soul. “But now, since you have been liberated from sin and have become enslaved to God, you have your fruit, which results in sanctification–and the end is eternal life!” (Romans 6:22 HCSB)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If Christ is the authority over your life, His continual call is to learn from Him and enter into rest for your soul. Ultimately, your freedom is yoked to your dependence on the Lord Jesus Christ, and His invitation is always the same, “Come to me.” (Matthew 11:28)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>In order to submit to Jesus’ yoke, He said to “learn from me.” (Matthew 11:29) It is possible to be saved without being a disciple of Christ. Do I rely more on an individual or the authority of the Word of God to grow in Christ? How can I invest in my growth by reading/listening to the Bible today?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Reflect on where you are in the process of experiencing God’s freedom. Write down what burdens you the most at this point in your life. Talk to the Lord about it. Ask for His empowerment to walk with Him in freedom.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Heavenly Father, thank You that You have set me free through faith in Jesus Christ. Lord, I desire to live in the full extent of freedom purchased for me. Help me to wear Your yoke and learn from You. Empower me to stand firm against what would enslave me. Lead me to rest in Your authority. In the liberating name of Jesus Christ, I pray. Amen</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>1.

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“So, if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.”</em>&nbsp;(John 8:36)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty (emancipation from bondage, freedom).”</em>&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 3:17 AMP)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Many of us struggle to accept the freedom we have in Christ. We find freedom from bondage and experience the abundant life God has for us, only when we rest in Christ and not the laws of man. This freedom is evident when people can rejoice in the liberty purchased for them by the Lord, and see the rest it brings to their souls. When we live according to the Holy Spirit standing firm in freedom from bondage, it brings wholeness and liberty to our lives.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we turn from freedom we are essentially obligating ourselves “to keep the whole Law.” (Galatians 5:3) There is no chance that we’re ever going to be able to do that. It makes us focused on what “I” can do verses what Christ has done. To turn back to bondage, we would not be living where Christ is operating. If you add anything to Christ, you lose Christ. We must not remain enslaved to the world’s lie that our value and worth are based upon our performance. We can never be good enough on our own. His yoke is easy; in the original Greek this word means kind and gracious. (Matthew 11:30) Turning to the Law takes away the grace that gives us our freedom.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>If we are ever going to experience freedom, we must begin to see ourselves as free. Do you see yourself as free? Freedom truly starts and takes place in our mind, which goes to our heart. “As a man thinks in his heart, so is he.”&nbsp;(Proverbs 23:7)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We must renew our mind with God’s Word that tells of our identity in&nbsp;Christ. Are you in the Word each day, allowing Christ to fill you with His truth? We no longer need the Law to keep us in God’s will, we have the leading of the Holy Spirit.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Are you living in the freedom Christ gives you? Christ died to set us free from bondage. You are beloved in His eyes, and His desire for you is to live in freedom.<br><strong><br>Prayer</strong><br>Father, we love and adore You, and thank You for your Son. &nbsp;Allow us to always see the freedom You have given each of us, and keep us from ever turning back to bondage. &nbsp;Let us feel and know the deep love You have for us, even to give Your only Son to set us free. &nbsp;Amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“It is for freedom that Christ has set us free.”</em>&nbsp;(Galatians 5:1 NIV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ.”</em>&nbsp;(Philippians 2:5 NIV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Imitating Christ is one of our highest callings as believers. I know in my life, I am in a constant pursuit to be more Christ-like in my marriage, my practice, and my interactions with others in the community. As you read further in Philippians, it says that Christ while “being in the very nature of God, did not consider equality with God as something to be grasped, but made himself nothing.” (Philippians 2:6-7 NIV) Jesus was obedient to humble himself lowly enough to be human even though he was God. What a stark contrast from what we know happened in Genesis 3 with the fall of man in the Garden of Eden where man wanted to exalt himself.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the Garden, the serpent manipulated and deceived Eve into believing that being equal to God was something to be grasped, while disobeying the divine pronouncement to not eat from that tree. Adam and Eve’s sin brought the wave of brokenness and separation from God for all people. “Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men.” (Romans 5:18 NIV) Because of what Christ did for us, we are thus set free from condemnation and can now walk in a divine relationship with our Abba, Father.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As believers and followers of Jesus Christ we now have this freedom to be more like him. &nbsp;We have freedom to be Christ-like. As Christ obeyed his Father, we now have the freedom to adopt an attitude like Jesus. An attitude of humility and not selfish-ambition. An attitude of love and service, and not hate.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Can you identify times in your Christian walk where you have attempted to model the humility of Christ? How did that make you feel about yourself? How did it impact your relationship with God and others?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In what ways can you be encouraged or reminded to seek out Christ’s attitude daily?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Father, thank You for sending Your Son Jesus to bridge the gap of my separation from You. Help me to walk in a spirit of humility daily and bless my pursuit of having an attitude that resembles that of Your Son. Amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“Look: I, Paul, say to you that if you accept circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you. I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that he is obligated to keep the whole law. You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace.”</em>&nbsp;(Galatians 5:2-4 NLT)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How is it that we can make simple questions seem so complex? Oftentimes, it’s because we have trouble believing that the answer can truly be that simple. When it comes to salvation, the answer is simple. God is the prize we seek and He is standing there with salvation in His hand saying, “Take it.” Is it really that simple? Yes.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our culture loves to emphasize the phrase earn it, but that is not how God works when it comes to eternity. Paul tells us that we can’t earn our way to become right with God. Nobody would make it to Heaven if that were the case, for we are incapable of saving ourselves. “Do not be afraid, for I have ransomed you. I have called you by name; you are mine.” (Isaiah 43:1 NLT) Ransomed means payment for redemption; it’s an action we could never do on our own because we were slaves to sin.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This drives me to my knees because while I didn’t earn salvation, I also didn’t deserve it. God loves us so much that He wouldn’t let us get what we deserve. “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Romans 6:23 NLT) When we place our faith in Christ, God doesn’t see our sin when He looks at us, instead He sees His perfect Son. Paul tells us that if we think our actions make us right with God, then we are saying Christ died for nothing. “I do not treat the grace of God as meaningless. For if keeping the law could make us right with God, then there was no need for Christ to die.” (Galatians 2:21 NLT) We cannot both serve the law and receive the grace of God.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Meditate on Galatians 5:2-4 with the message Paul is giving us, then pray over Galatians 2:21. Are you still trying to earn your way to God?<br>Consider the week ahead. How can you specifically live out your days with humility by accepting the grace and salvation God has given?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your Word to remind us of who You are and how You love us. Please challenge us and reveal to us our need for You and what areas in our life we need to give back to You. Let us not rest our salvation on our shoulders but trust in You alone. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“Look: I, Paul, say to you that if you accept circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you.&nbsp;I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that he is obligated to keep the whole law.&nbsp;You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace.”</em>&nbsp;(Galatians 5:2-4 ESV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ok, strange verse to just jump off with, but hear me out… While this verse appears to be about circumcision (and I’m sure you’re loving that topic), it’s really about the idea of works saving us. Works being “something you do.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Hebrew people were marked by circumcision. That means if you were Jewish, you were circumcised. It made you “part of the faith,” which in a way led to your identification in the faith. Now, I’m not really interested in going into Judaism and circumcision, so let’s just get to the point. You ready? Here is it.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You cannot be saved by works. Period.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Read that again. And again. And again. There is no work you can do that will save you. Paul is telling the Galatians that if they think that circumcision will ‘mark them as God’s own’ (the way it did with the Jews), then they might as well keep the whole law. And if they keep the whole law, guess what- They’ll never be saved. Need proof? See Romans 8:3.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh”</em>&nbsp;(Romans 8:3 ESV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The world loves this idea of earning your way into Heaven, or into being saved. Everyone loves to think that if you’re good enough, God will just grant you salvation. Can you imagine if that was true? What is the threshold? What is good enough? What if I’m not good enough, but I try really hard? I can’t imagine what a faith like that would do to me, other than cause me a lot of worry and stress.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But I don’t have to worry. I don’t have to stress. That’s because we are not saved by works, but by the sacrifice of Jesus. That’s it. He saves us by His blood, and through His resurrection. If you have saving faith in Jesus, you can rest assured that His grace is enough. If you want to know more about Jesus, well, you’re in the right place! Send us any questions you have and we’ll get back to you.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Be still and rest for a moment in the security of Jesus.<br>Think for a moment on what God has saved you from. Who were you? Who are you now?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Thank You, Jesus, for my salvation. Never let me doubt it. Help me to daily live for You and let my works demonstrate my faith. Thank You that my works don’t save me, but that You alone save me. In Jesus’ name; amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“For we through the Spirit, by faith, are waiting for the hope of righteousness.”</em>(Galatians 5:5 NASB)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish that I may gain Christ, and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes through God on the basis of faith.”</em>&nbsp;(Philippians 3:8-9 NASB)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">True freedom is not based on possibility but on reality. When Paul is writing to the Galatian church, he is challenging their beliefs. Many of them lived as if their relationship with God was based on what they could accomplish and achieve. If they did the right things and followed all the commandments, they believed then they would have right standing before God. The problem was this kind of thinking was keeping them in bondage. Why? Because in their own ability they were constantly trying to meet God’s standard, but never able to reach it.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And if we are honest, many of us look at our relationship with God the same way. And we are tired of trying to prove ourselves, say all the right things, accomplish huge victories, and overcome all obstacles. When we live this way, we are missing the freedom Christ offers. Paul reminds us in Galatians 5:5, “for we through the Spirit, by faith, are waiting for the hope of righteousness.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Righteousness is the condition of being acceptable to God, and the good news is as God’s children we don’t have to achieve that righteousness on our own. We have hope because our standing with God and our future is secure. When our walk with God is lived out of this reality, we find freedom.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>In Philippians 3:8-9 Paul shares that he counts everything a loss compared to knowing Jesus. At one point in his life, he had worked hard to reach God, but now he understood that righteousness only comes through Jesus. When he realized that, all the other things he had achieved and accomplished no longer had value. Is there anything you need to let go of that you have been depending on to please God?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Father, thank You that I have hope in You and my future is secure because of Jesus. Thank You that I don’t have to depend on my own abilities for my salvation. Help me see the ways I am depending on my righteousness instead of Yours. Thank You that I can live out truth and experience that freedom every day. In Jesus’ name; amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faith working through love.”</em>&nbsp;(Galatians 5:6 NASB)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.”</em>&nbsp;(1 John 4:10 NASB)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m an achiever. I thrive on strategic projects, overcoming obstacles and accomplishment. Basically, I like to do things and get things done. But because I love to do things so much, I often miss opportunities to sit and rest in the knowledge of who I am in Christ. And every time I realize these missed opportunities I feel less and less like a loving person because it affects what I do. That’s why I love the fact that Paul writes about faith working through love in Galatians 5:6. This faith is an often-misunderstood concept in today’s busy culture.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">John Piper puts it this way. “Works wants the thrill of feeling itself overcome an obstacle. Faith wants the thrill of feeling God overcome the obstacle.” Faith is what justifies us. It’s what saves us. It makes us right with God. This is what makes the gospel so unique. Every other religion in the world teaches that man must earn his way or prove himself somehow to be considered a member of the sect. But being a follower of Christ is unique in the fact that God accomplished everything that needed to be accomplished for us to be saved. That saving faith that we have in Jesus and what He has done is so beautiful because it actually produces love. Piper adds, “Being a loving person is absolutely essential to being saved, because the faith which saves by its very essence works through love.” So as faith pushes out guilt, fear, greed and selfishness, it frees us for love and gives us the courage to experience God’s power through the very acts of love that we do.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Take a moment and consider the wonderful grace, mercy and love of God. Think about how much love He has for you on the cross. Ask God to help you increase your faith in Him and rely less on works as a means of earning something or proving yourself. Consider responding in worship by playing/singing a few songs of praise.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Thank you, Jesus, for loving me so much that You gave Your life for me. Help me to trust in You in times when I lean towards trusting myself instead. Remind me of the beauty of the gospel when I forget. Show me how I can love others today. Free me from myself so that I can be the loving person that You want me to be. In Jesus’ name I pray; amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“You were running well. Who prevented you from obeying the truth? This persuasion did not come from the One who called you.”</em>&nbsp;(Gal. 5:7-8)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of Truth…”</em>(John 14:15-16)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Imagine running down a narrow street with the destination you ache for far off in the distance. The street is lined wall to wall with towering buildings. Tenants of all sorts lean out of windows shouting distractions with the intention of slowing you down. Living life as a Christ follower is similar. If we take our focus off of Jesus, truth can become twisted. Even believing a tiny amount of deception can convince us to rely on people or our own will power to run the race well. All of this noise and independence leads to vast confusion, throwing us off course. As children of God we must focus solely on Christ if we aim to stay the course He’s designed for us.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we depend exclusively on preachers, prayer warriors, praise bands, or ourselves, we may as well skip to the sidelines and move into one of those daunting buildings. Experiencing freedom hinges on our dependency on Christ alone. This dependent relationship looks like getting to know Jesus, God’s promises, His character through the pages of scripture and then following Him. “So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, “If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” (John 8:31-32) This in turn grows love for God, recognition of truth, and a made up mind to follow His life-giving ways. You have been freed to race past anything that persuades you otherwise. Run your race like you believe Him.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Freedom begins with honesty with God. Confess to the Lord your tendencies and weaknesses that distract you from following Him. Name every person or thing. Recount what it has cost you to chase something other than Him to fulfill, affirm, comfort or heal you.<br>Deliberately surrender to His Lordship again.<br>God is working in your life in ways you cannot imagine. Boldly invite Him to do whatever it takes for you to experience His freedom today.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Father, there is no one like You! Thank You for Your Spirit which leads me into all truth and helps me to live for Your glory and my good. I ask for Your grace to run well in obedience. Please silence every taunt that seeks to distract me from You. In Jesus’ name I pray; amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“A little leaven leavens a whole lump of dough.”</em>&nbsp;(Galatians 5:9 NASB)<br><em>“Your boasting is not good. &nbsp;Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough?”</em>&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 5:6 NASB)<br>When a small bit of leaven (yeast) is added to dough it causes it to rise, which Paul uses in this passage to illustrate how the false doctrine of the Judaizers was introduced to the Galatian churches. Paul mentions it again in 1 Corinthians 5:6-7.&nbsp;Paul is specifically referencing legalism that has crept into the gospel at the church in Galatia and has distorted the gospel’s truth.<br>Before long the “yeast” grew and eventually took over the church. The spirit of legalism does not suddenly overpower a church but like leaven it is introduced secretly, it grows and before long poisons the whole assembly. Turning to the law for salvation hinders the progress of believers.&nbsp;Paul’s words were relevant then, and they are applicable to our lives today.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Leaven doesn’t always equal legalism, however. The leaven principle applies to every area of our lives. Think of all the ways little things can harm our lives. What is the impact of just a&nbsp;little&nbsp;immorality, saying just a&nbsp;few&nbsp;offensive words, telling just&nbsp;one&nbsp;“white lie,” or giving into just a&nbsp;few&nbsp;lustful thoughts?&nbsp;Do you spend a little time with the wrong people? Do you listen to the wrong message? Do you occasionally view something inappropriate on TV or videos?<br>Think about the choices you’re making. Don’t use your freedom for the wrong purposes. Be careful not to sow the wrong seeds or sow seeds into activities that can poison your life.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Father, may our heart always yearn to be in Your will, live the life You have designed for us and lean not on our own understanding. Fill our hearts and minds with the truth of Your word. Let it penetrate every part of our being. You and You alone are worthy. Thank You for the guidance of Your word. Let us never turn away from it. In Jesus’ name; amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“Brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished.”</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 5:11 NIV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What then shall we say? That the Gentiles that did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith; but Israel, who pursued a law of righteousness, has not attained it. Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling block.” (Romans 9:30-32 NIV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles”</em>&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 1:23 NIV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">August is here and that means two things for us: back to school is in full swing and the college football season is rapidly approaching. Many of us UVA Cavalier fans know that the new head football coach, Bronco Mendenhall, has brought a tough and gritty mentality to the culture of this team. His team’s motto is “Earned Not Given.” This means that his players will have to earn everything by working tirelessly through physical and mental challenges. Nothing will be handed out to them.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This mentality of earned not given was the same belief the Israelites had in the Bible about their relationship with the Lord. As you read in Romans 9 above, they pursued righteousness with God through their works alone. The Jews were in search of a Messiah who was a King; who would triumphantly position them for success in the world. They weren’t looking for a servant God who would sacrifice his Son, Jesus Christ on a cross. They struggled to believe in who Jesus was and that he was here to bridge the gap between God and men.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Because of the work Jesus did on the cross, earning your righteousness through works is dead and faith in who Jesus Christ is and what he did for us was birthed. A radical paradigm shift from earned not given to given not earned was set. This is amazing grace.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Can you identify times in your Christian walk where you struggled to accept that works alone can’t bring righteousness with God? Do you see the cross being a stumbling block in the thoughts and beliefs of those around you? How does it make you feel knowing that God intervened and made a way for you to seek relationship with him through his Son?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Father, thank You for sending Your son Jesus to raise up those who believe in You. Help us to be constantly reminded of the grace You gave us through Jesus. Teach us to boldly share with others the Good News of a relationship with You that is given and not earned. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“For you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus. And all who have been united with Christ in baptism have put on Christ, like putting on new clothes.”</em>&nbsp;(Galatians 3:26-27 NLT)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You have been called and you answered. Answering yes to Christ means 1 – You are a child of God. 2 – You are united with Christ, including the body of Christ (the church).&nbsp;3 – You are made new. The Bible says that accepting and following Christ means you are made new! It doesn’t say you’re refurbished, remade or have gotten a good washing… You’re NEW! New means that all those chains and sinful ways that gripped you before are completely gone and forgotten by God, so they should be forgotten by you. You are free, truly free. You have been called to live in this freedom.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Freedom in God’s eyes has a beauty unlike anything we can comprehend. Our freedom in Christ means the old life is so far gone that God doesn’t even see our slavery, but sees His perfect Son when He looks at us. So why do we lay gripped in fear of the chains that held us down and God destroyed forever? “This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!” (2 Corinthians 5:17 NLT) It is difficult sometimes, because the world tells us that we are still slaves and it evens sometimes tells us that slavery is good. Our hope, strength and trust, however, can be drawn from being rooted in the truths that are spoken by God throughout the Bible. God has never wavered or contradicted Himself. “Don’t lie to each other, for you have stripped off your old sinful nature and all its wicked deeds. Put on your new nature, and be renewed as you learn to know your Creator and become like him.” (Colossians 3:9-10 NLT) Don’t listen to the world. Listen to your Savior who has set you free.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>New means that your chains are broken and you are no longer a slave, but set free in Christ. Consider the mountains and valleys in life that you face. Are you believing you are refurbished or believing that you are made new?<br>Since God has called us to freedom, we therefore know that the feelings of fear and captivity are not of God. What thoughts do you need to give to God because they are an obstacle for you to living&nbsp;in freedom?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Heavenly Father, we praise You for Your goodness and power that has saved us from captivity and brought us to live in freedom with You, forever. Please forgive us for our struggle to rid our minds of the chains You have forgotten. We need Your encouragement and wisdom so we can be strengthened to stand unwavering, living as the son or daughter You have called us to be. In Jesus’ name; amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“It is absolutely clear that God has called you to a free life. Just make sure that you don’t use this freedom as an excuse to do whatever you want to do and destroy your freedom. Rather, use your freedom to serve one another in love; that’s how freedom grows.”</em>&nbsp;(Galatians 5:13 MSG)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m a literalist. That’s why I prefer the NASB or ESV translation pretty much 99.9% of the time. But then there are those times where a paraphrase like The Message does a really good job breaking down a literal verse into a practical application. Therefore, I chose to use The Message translation for today’s blog.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have a bit of a challenge for you today. Rather than breaking down this verse for you, I want to have you try something with this verse. It’s sort of a call-and-response to reading Scripture. I want you to take these three sentences and read them one-at-a-time, over and over, emphasizing different words in the sentence. I’ll show you how it works in this first one.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It is absolutely clear that God has called you to a free life.” Ready? Watch.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It is absolutely clear that God has called you to a free life.” Now pray a response. “God, Thank You that You have made my freedom 100%. It cannot be called into question. It is absolute.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It is absolutely clear that God has called you to a free life.” Now pray a response. “God, thank you for providing a simple and easy-to-understand path to freedom: Your son, Jesus. Help me to not overcomplicate that gospel truth in my life.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It is absolutely clear that God has called you to a free life.” Now pray a response. “Thank You, and You alone, for my salvation. Thank You that You didn’t just save me from death, but You prepared a life of freedom for me.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It is absolutely clear that God has called you to a free life.” Now pray a response. “Help me to be what You called me to be. Thank You for calling me to freedom.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It is absolutely clear that God has called you to a free life.” Now pray a response. “My chains are broken and I am free. Help me remember this truth every minute of every day.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">See how cool it is? What you’re actually doing here is mining a verse for depth. You’re also conversing with God. As He speaks through the Scriptures, you speak right back. Now give it a try with the next two sentences. Why not make this how you read the Scriptures for the rest of your life?</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“But now that you have come to know God, or rather be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental things, to which you desire to be enslaved all over again?”</em>&nbsp;(Galatians 4:9 NASB)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Sow with a view to righteousness, reap in accordance with kindness; break up your fallow ground, for it is time to seek the LORD until He comes to rain righteousness on you.”</em>&nbsp;(Hosea 10:12 NASB)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The easy path is usually not the best path, and the path to freedom can be incredibly painful.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you give me the choice between comfort and pain, my natural choice is always comfort. &nbsp;In fact, I prefer to avoid discomfort altogether! I would rather sleep in instead of work out. &nbsp;I would rather eat what tastes good over what is good for me. &nbsp;I would rather walk the other way then to face conflict. &nbsp;And I would rather stay where I am spiritually then to allow God to change me. &nbsp;But I have a choice. Do I step into temporary pain or discomfort for what I ultimately know is best, or do I settle for staying comfortable?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I remember a season of my life when from the outside I was doing all the right things – I was in church, I studied and prayed every day, and I was even attending Bible college. &nbsp;My outside performance looked good, but the truth was, I was avoiding God. I was busy trying to impress Him, but I didn’t want to allow Him on the inside. &nbsp;I had a comfortable way of living, and that included avoiding looking too deeply into my heart and soul.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In this season, I heard a speaker share from Hosea 10:12 and through that God took me to a new level of freedom. &nbsp;Here God uses the illustration of hard ground to describe our lives. Hard ground does not soak in the rain. &nbsp;In order to receive the rain, hard ground has to be broken up. &nbsp;In other words, God wants to work deep in my life, not just on the surface. &nbsp;But in order for Him to do this I have to go through the painful process of breaking up the hard places in my heart. &nbsp;I have to face my fears and insecurities. &nbsp;I have to stop avoiding God, and truly allow Him in the hidden places of my soul.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God wants you to experience freedom, and that means you have to let go of comfortable places and patterns and allow God in to the deep places of your life. The path to freedom may be painful, but it the good kind of pain, the pain that yields great results.<br><strong><br>Reflection</strong><br>What area of your life do you want to avoid looking at? &nbsp;Are you choosing a familiar and comfortable path over the freedom that God offers?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>God, I want to fully experience Your freedom. &nbsp;I give You permission to go into the deep places of my heart and reveal the areas that need to change. &nbsp;I want to know You more and reflect You to others. I am willing to walk that path, even when it is painful. &nbsp;In Jesus’ name; amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.”</em>&nbsp;(Galatians 5:13 NASB)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Calling them to Himself, Jesus said to them, “You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great men exercise authority over them. But it is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant; and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.”</em>&nbsp;(Mark 10:42-45 NASB)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If anyone has ever had reason to serve himself, it was Jesus. And yet The King of Kings – Lamb of God – Light of the World – God Himself emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, being made in the likeness of men, humbled Himself in obedience, leading to history’s greatest act of love… death on a cross for the sins of the world (Philippians 2:7-8). In essence, the life of Christ was willingly given for us. Jesus came to serve.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The sacrifice made by Jesus makes us free from sin. But it also makes us free for service to others. Being free from sin is not a license to do whatever you want. But rather an opportunity to serve one another in love by dying to yourself. That’s the very nature of serving. It’s a bit of an anomaly that God calls us to use our freedom to choose to do something to serve someone else.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>How are you using your freedom to serve others? What outlets do you have that you can utilize in serving? Who do you know that could really use your service this week? Take a moment and write a list of people you’d like to serve and how you’d like to serve them. But don’t stop there. Draft a plan of execution and follow through! Share your stories with us here online! We’d love to hear about them.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Jesus, thank You for giving Your life for me. Thank You for freeing me for freedom. Lord, I ask you to give me Your eyes and help me to see the world the way You see it. Open my eyes to see the number of opportunities to serve that are around me today. Stir my heart to die to self and serve others and serve You. In Jesus’ name I pray; amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br>“For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. &nbsp;For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”” (Galatians 5:13-14 ESV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“But the one who peers into the perfect law of liberty and fixes his attention there, and does not become a forgetful listener but one who lives it out—he will be blessed in what he does.” (James 1:25 NET Bible)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The freedom offered by Christ comes with Christ. Laying down our agenda to receive the freedom of Heaven’s King will never lead to insignificance and a life fretted away. But, instead through His leadership we find ourselves on an adventure through the mundane to peace, joy and purpose. His purposes for us. “For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.” (Ephesians 2:10 ESV) Our thinking as Christ followers should be to consider ourselves on assignment from Heaven, to live life as if we’re on an errand from God. When we walk into a room consider where the Spirit of God is at work. What is He doing? And then join Him there; copy what Jesus might do if physically in your shoes. Whoever may be in front of you, serve them – love them well. This is not the ‘Golden Rule’ or treating people the way you would like to be treated. This is a unique idea that Jesus gave voice to and lived out for us to follow.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?” And he said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.” (Matthew 22:36-40 ESV) Jesus is essentially saying that loving your neighbor is equal to loving God.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus gave up Heaven with the Presence of God, where there is no darkness, full of the colors, sounds, souls, creations unimaginable that reflect pure love, for you. He walked in dust for 30 some years yearning for His Father, on Heaven’s errand, for you. He was tormented and tortured for you. He conquered death through resurrection and was witnessed by over 500 people walking this earth He created, for you (1 Corinthians 15:3-8). He then returned to His throne where He rules and reigns supreme over all matter to prepare a place for you (Mark 16:19, John 14:2). How little we think of Jesus and God’s love for Him, and His love for us that we use our freedom as an opportunity to please ourselves, rather than serve others with that very love lavished on us (Galatians 5:13).</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The gospel says through the grace of His Spirit we can love and respond to people as Christ would have us. The amazing thrill of it is that when we do, we experience the well-being His freedom promises. We find in the process of giving ourselves, the end result is so much better, than the momentary highs of self-satisfaction. It is a great privilege and gift Christ offers, not an obligation. It is our freedom.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflect</strong><br>Jesus said, “A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.” (John 13:34 ESV) Rewrite this verse and add your name as if Jesus is speaking to you. Who is He placing on your heart to love, to forgive, to serve? Replace “one another” with the name of this person or people.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Heavenly Father, Your constant love directed toward me is too great to fathom. You understand my ways, yet continually see me in a forgiven light because of Jesus, holy and welcome in Your presence. Thank You! Empower me to love well whomever You place in front of me today. I open my heart to Your direction and ask for grace to love like my Lord. In Jesus’ name; amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“Therefore, repent and return, so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord.”</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 3:19 NASB)<br>“Can’t you see that his kindness is intended to turn you from you sin?” (NLT)<br>If you have ever felt regret and changed your mind, you are aware of the basis of one of the most important spiritual principles in the Bible – Repentance. &nbsp;It is the one and only way to peace.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We need to go to God and ask forgiveness, change our minds, make a 180 degree turn and go towards God’s word. &nbsp;&nbsp;Encompass it, breathe it, live it out fully. &nbsp;Repentance requires taking a new point of view;&nbsp;looking at it God’s way. God simply asks us to turn. It is a change of our heart along with behavior choices. &nbsp;It is a response of the total person, a total surrender.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We repent in our initial conversion as a Christian, but it is a constant checking of our heart condition throughout life. It is not just being sorry, or apologizing when getting caught; that’s remorse. &nbsp;In essence, anything that is not a Godly response in any of our circumstances and relationships is sin. &nbsp;The sin in which we need to repent for, creates a chasm between God and us that cannot be bridged by our own human efforts. &nbsp;No matter what you have done, God has made a way home — through his Son, Jesus Christ.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>We all need to repent. &nbsp;It is ongoing. &nbsp;Things creep into our lives so subtlety. It could be something as simple as envy, control or pride. &nbsp;Ask God to show you what you might need to repent about today. &nbsp;Not only do we need to ask for forgiveness, but we also need to change our mind and heart toward contentment instead of envy; total surrender instead of control; or humility instead of pride.<br>Your heavenly Father is not looking for ways to punish you. God is just, but He is also a loving Father, patiently waiting with open arms.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Precious Father, I know that I am a sinner and need Your forgiveness. &nbsp;&nbsp;Your Word says that it is Your patience and kindness that leads me to repentance. So, I come to You humbly, and confess my sin. I thank You that You forgive me by the blood of Jesus, and ask for a fresh cleansing of my body, soul and spirit. Teach me how to walk honestly before You in repentance every day. In Jesus’ name; amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“For you have been called to live in freedom, my brothers and sisters. But don’t use your freedom to satisfy your sinful nature. Instead, use your freedom to serve one another in love. For the whole law can be summed up in this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” But if you are always biting and devouring one another, watch out! Beware of destroying one another.”</em>&nbsp;(Galatians 5:13-15 NIV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As I was given the task of sharing my insight from the Holy Spirit with you on this section of scripture, I kept getting drawn to the end of Galatians 5:13. Serve humbly in love. &nbsp;These three words: serve, humble and love are important actions and characteristics of the life that God desires for us all. These words get me really excited and passionate about life but I am always open to discovering more about their intended meaning in my life. So I felt that I should dig down into the original Greek and see if there was more clarity to be had.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What I found was really interesting. If you go to Blue Letter Bible, it will break down each word from a verse in the original Greek language. I found love was translated from the noun agape and serve came from the Greek verb douleuo. When I searched for humbly, there wasn’t a Greek translation for it. When I looked at other biblical translations, I found that the word humbly was not there. The NKJV, NASB and many others said “serve in love.” Only NIV had humbly included. When I looked at the description for douleuo it says: serve, bondage, and service. Wow. Bondage, as in slavery? I thought about the idea of slavery and how it is a way of fully submitting oneself to another. To me, slavery intrinsically runs parallel with humility. &nbsp;There isn’t always need to add humility when referencing bondage and service.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As you look at the words earlier in the verse, it says that because of our new freedom in Christ as believers, we should use our freedom to serve one another in love. Or basically because you are free, you should focus on service for others with love instead of indulging in desires of the flesh (mentioned in Galatians 5:19-21). This is radical!! This is the antithesis of self-preservation and comfort. This is agape love though, am I right? This is un-conditional, lay it all out, sacrificial, undeserving passion for those that don’t deserve it. But this is Jesus. This is the Christ who came down to serve and not be served. Let us seek to be more like Him in our serving one another with love.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>How does the idea of serving like a slave for the well-being of others with love make you feel? What are some practical ways that you can serve with love today?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Father, thank You for the power in Your scripture. Thank You that You call us out to be spirit led and give us the tools of the Holy Spirit to love others without conditions. Help us to align our heart with the Holy Spirit in us as we serve others. In Jesus’ name; amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“So I say, let the Holy Spirit guide your lives. Then you won’t be doing what your sinful nature craves…Since we are living by the Spirit, let us follow the Spirit’s leading in every part of our lives.”</em>&nbsp;(Galatians 5:16, 25 NLT)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I grew up playing soccer and my coach never took us into a game without first taking us through practice. Each practice was tailored to prepare us for the battle ahead. Once we were in games, the coach remained on the sidelines to see how we paid attention in practice and to give guidance when needed. God does this in our lives, and does it perfectly: the Bible is our spiritual playbook from God, the Spirit is the voice in the game reminding us what we learned (John 16:13-15), and God already went before us and won the battle!</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Probably the most difficult part about growing in my relationship with God was learning to listen to the Spirit, mainly because I had no idea what the Spirit sounded like so I was waiting to hear what I expected. I realized how much of this struggle was rooted in my level of faith, and my ability to stop talking and start listening to God. I decided to take it to God in prayer and wow, did God answer! I learned on a mission trip last year that the Spirit is the most peaceful and beautiful sound that a heart could ever experience. When I was in so much confusion and chaos, a friend reminded me of the peace and clarity God gave me before the chaos. When you’re in the game, the opponent will try to throw you into confusion and get you to forget your game plan. We like to call that doubt, but God isn’t a God of confusion. He is a God of peace (1 Corinthians 14:33). Recalling God’s Word in a storm, and feeling peace when the storm tells you it’s anything but peaceful, is allowing yourself to be guided by the Spirit (Romans 8:14-16). To be guided by the Spirit we need to prepare for the game (read the Bible) and get into the game (where the Spirit works).</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>“For God is not a God of disorder but of peace, as in all the meetings of God’s holy people.” (1Corinthians 14:33) We all go through seasons of mountains and valleys, but sometimes we get stuck in the valleys longer than desired because confusion creeps in and we don’t know which way is up. If you’re currently in a valley, where can you see the peace of God?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We often forget all of what God does for us. We overlook that God prepared a way for us long before we were born, that God is with us now and the He has gone before us victoriously in all future trials we may face. He is deserving of more credit and praise than we can ever give.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Heavenly Father, thank You that You do not leave us to walk through this world alone. Thank You for giving us Your Spirit to be in our hearts to speak truth and life into our lives as a reminder of Your goodness. Thank You that doubt and chaos and disorder isn’t of you. God we need You. Please give us the strength to look past the confusion and chaos, and choose to hear and listen to Your peace, guidance and truth. Thank you for blessing us with Your best for our lives. In Jesus’ name; amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><em><br>“But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please.”</em>&nbsp;Galatians 5:16-17</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Friends, you are in a war. This war isn’t going to be over anytime soon, either. It’s going to be long, and it’s going to be difficult. You’ll have battles in this war – daily battles. The most interesting about this war is that the outcome of every battle is 100% dependent on your will to overcome it. In war, the enemy strategizes against you. He’s unpredictable. But in this war, you actually can win every single battle because it’s something you have control of.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m talking about the war between your flesh and your Spirit. I have two thoughts for you about this war.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">First, just because you can win every battle doesn’t mean you will win every battle. I fully believe that we can choose to do right, but the fact of the matter is that we won’t always make that decision. This isn’t a license to keep sinning, but rather an admission that we’re going to fall short. So this first fact is this: you’re going to lose sometimes. And that’s ok. Our faith is about progress. Two steps forward and one step back is still one step forward. You can’t let the one step back knock you out completely and cause you to give up. When your flesh wins, repent and move forward.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Second, celebrate victories. Life isn’t easy. This war isn’t easy. When you follow the instructions in this verse, and you walk by the Spirit, celebrate those victories! What does that look like? It means thanking God for seeing you through. It means acknowledging your growth and victory on the journey. It’s ok to pat yourself on the back occasionally because of how you’ve grown, because of your ability to walk by the Spirit, and because of where God has brought you. So celebrate those victories when you have them. They may keep you going through the next battle.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>“God, help me to walk by the Spirit daily. Keep my eyes on You, and keep my focus on overcoming the battles of the flesh. Help me to stay encouraged when I fall short, and help me to celebrate when I stay strong. Amen.”</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please.”</em>&nbsp;(Galatians 5:17 NASB)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace, because the mind set on the flesh is hostile to God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do so, and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.”</em>&nbsp;(Romans 8:6-8)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Recently I had one of the moments. &nbsp;The ones you wish you could take back. A situation surfaced and I over-reacted. The words that came out of my mouth were too strong and as soon as they came out, I wished I could put them back in. &nbsp;As I reflected on the moment, I was hoping to find a justification for what happened, but the truth was there was no excuse, no one to blame it. &nbsp;It was all on me.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In that moment, I was giving into what Galatians 5 refers to as my flesh. &nbsp;Flesh is my human nature or my natural behavior outside of God’s influence. God makes it very clear, when we walk in freedom we learn a new way of living through the power of His Spirit. &nbsp;And when we live out of our flesh we are living in opposition to His way and cannot please Him.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is important to learn to fight the flesh.<br>Here are a few ways to engage in that fight:<br>Choose to be honest. &nbsp;When you struggle, don’t try to hide from it – recognize it. Call it what it is. (Ephesians 5:19-21)<br>Once you recognize an area of struggle, ask God to help you identify the source. &nbsp;What event, belief, or pattern led to this behavior? (Romans 12:2)<br>Understand you can only fight the flesh by the Spirit. &nbsp;You cannot overcome on your own, you need God’s power. (Ephesians 6:12-13)<br>Learn what it looks like to respond or think about this God’s way. &nbsp;Search the Bible to see what God says about this struggle. (Hebrews 4:12)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Think back over the last few days – what area(s) are you giving into your flesh? &nbsp;What step will you take to fight your flesh?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>God, forgive me for ___________. &nbsp;I know that when I _________, I am living by my flesh and that does not please You. &nbsp;Help me to walk by Your Spirit. &nbsp;Thank You for giving me freedom from sin so that I can live for You. Amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law.”</em>&nbsp;(Galatians 5:18 NASB)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.”</em>&nbsp;(Romans 8:14 NASB)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The concept of lion taming has always intrigued me. Perhaps it fascinates me so much because I don’t quite understand it. How can a 400-pound apex predator be led by a 180-pound human? The lion outweighs the man, he is faster than the man, he is louder than the man, and he is stronger than the man. And yet the man still subdues the lion when the lion is not to be subdued. I’m only left wondering, how often do I try to subdue The Lion of Judah?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">More often than I’d like to admit, I find myself trying to lead God into doing what I’d like to see Him do for my life. Make no mistake, God is subdued by no one and He is led by no man. He willingly laid down His life for us so that His love would abide in us and lead us into righteousness (John 10:17-18; 1 John 3:16-17). So then how do we fool ourselves into thinking we can lead God? The reality is we don’t lead Him; He leads us. Being led by the Spirit means continuously surrendering yourself to the desires of the Holy Spirit, which includes battling the desires of your sinful flesh (Galatians 5:17). &nbsp;Being led by the Spirit means choosing to say yes to the will of God and no to the desires of the flesh. Being led by the Spirit means exposing your heart to grace of Jesus and confidently claiming His victory over sin.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Take a moment and ask yourself, “Am I trying to lead God? Or am I allowing Him to lead me?” Search your heart and examine if there is anything in your flesh that you are allowing to have its own way. Would your life look differently if you surrendered your will to the leading of the Holy Spirit? Are there any actions you need to take or conversations you need to have in following the Spirit’s leading? If there is anything in you that is not currently resisting evil then are you truly a child of God? May God remove any veils that blind.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Holy Spirit, stir my affections for You. Awaken in me a strong desire to surrender my carnal impulses on a moment-by-moment basis. I pray that You would give me the strength to apply what I know into active service so that You would find me faithful in following You. In Jesus’ name I pray; amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“It is obvious what kind of life develops out of trying to get your own way all the time: repetitive, loveless, cheap sex; a stinking accumulation of mental and emotional garbage; frenzied and joyless grabs for happiness; trinket gods; magic-show religion; paranoid loneliness; cutthroat competition; all-consuming-yet-never-satisfied wants; a brutal temper; an impotence to love or be loved; divided homes and divided lives; small-minded and lopsided pursuits; the vicious habit of depersonalizing everyone into a rival; uncontrolled and uncontrollable addictions; ugly parodies of community. I could go on.</em><br><em>This isn’t the first time I have warned you, you know. If you use your freedom this way, you will not inherit God’s kingdom.</em><br><em>But what happens when we live God’s way? He brings gifts into our lives, much the same way that fruit appears in an orchard—things like affection for others, exuberance about life, serenity. We develop a willingness to stick with things, a sense of compassion in the heart, and a conviction that a basic holiness permeates things and people. We find ourselves involved in loyal commitments, not needing to force our way in life, able to marshal and direct our energies wisely.”</em>&nbsp;(Galatians 5:19-23 MSG)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I remember asking our children when they were little, “Why did you color on the couch – with lipstick?” Or, “Why did you eat the whole stick of butter?” Makes me laugh now, all those “why” questions that were answered with a feeble “I don’t know.” As an adult, I can still relate to their lack of understanding.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Paul shares that our actions are often dictated by something we do not fully comprehend. (Romans 7:15-18) Certainly, we could blame the world or the demonic, but most often it’s our old nature that pulls us toward expressing sin in the way we think and the choices we make. Our flesh turns on us and seeks to seize an opportunity to trip us up. Even in identifying with Christ’s death and resurrection we cannot in our own power resist our sinful desires. And it is impossible to move in two directions at once – pleasing our flesh and pleasing God. They are in direct opposition in character and tendency.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our antidote to this bossy flesh is to be led by the locomotive power of the Holy Spirit – to walk by and live by the Spirit. (Galatians 5:16,25) It is His divine power that “has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness.” (2 Peter 1:3) With regard to other deceiving factors we are reminded that “He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.” (1 John 4:4) We have been generously guaranteed the victory if we choose to follow Christ who “always leads us in triumphal procession.” (2 Corinthians 2:14) But don’t be confused. This is not the wave of a magic wand. The empowerment of the Holy Spirit or grace is not activated until we make the decision to follow His will.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have this memory of closely following my dad on a hiking trail when I was a little girl. He would take what seemed like a giant stretch of a step, leaving a clear shoe imprint in the dirt. With eyes narrowly focused on that foot print, I would practically leap to land exactly where he left his mark. Following the Spirit is similar. Let Him leave His mark of truth. Only He can do that. Only you can let Him. And then follow His trail one step at a time.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>So often the reason for our frustration and failure is our ridiculous attempt to please both our selfish desires and the Lord. The Spirit and our flesh will never be productive partners. Consider where you are experiencing defeat. Are you trying to please your desires or are you following the Lord in His ways?<br>How does God want you to respond to what you have read today?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Heavenly Father, thank You for allowing me the privilege of being Your child. I don’t to please my sinful nature; I want to please You. Father, mark my life with Your truth. I ask for Your empowerment as I choose to follow You in response to Your love. In the all-powerful name of Jesus Christ, I pray; amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.”</em>&nbsp;(Galatians 5:1 ESV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have your head and your heart ever been misaligned? For most people (and for most of our time), our head leads our heart or our heart leads our head. That means that your feelings are driven by your thoughts, or your thoughts are driven by your feelings. Right or wrong, that is how everyone walks through life.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But, what if you walk through a season where neither is leading the other, a season where your head and your heart are misaligned? Think about it: you know the truth, but you feel differently. I have spent some time there recently, and it’s a very unsettling place.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Recently, I lost a friend through an unfortunate circumstance. Without going into all the details, it was a suicide and it really shook my world and community. It seemed as if all of us in her circle were walking in a similar place of head and heart misalignment, as we all knew (head) there was nothing we could have done, but we all felt (heart) guilt as if we didn’t do enough.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This blog isn’t meant to be about suicide or that specific situation, but I think it helps make the point that head and heart misalignment is a reality. I’ve seen it so much in the body of Christ as well. This verse in Galatians really speaks this condition.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christ has set us free. That is truth. That is from the scripture we just read. And it’s past tense, so there’s nothing more to do. If you’re in Christ, you have been set free.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But many of us don’t feel free, do we? We feel the “yoke of slavery.” We feel like failures. We feel like sinners without hope. We feel like giving up.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That, my friends, is head and heart misalignment. Do you know what the cure is? Believing the truth in-spite of what you feel. You have to let truth ground you and make a level playing field. It is the only thing that can lead us out of misalignment. The truth for Christians is that Christ has set us free, so you don’t need to keep feeling like you’re not free.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Throughout this month, you’ll hear more on how to practically do this through the series, your group, and these blogs. Make it a priority to get your head and your heart aligned!</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>1. What truth do you need to start believing and feeling?<br>2. How would believing that truth change your life?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>“Jesus, help me to believe Your truth about me. Thank You for setting me free! Let me be grounded in truth – the truth that comes from You. In Your name, amen.”</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br>“It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.” (Galatians 5:1 NASB)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.” (Galatians 5:13 NASB)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus gave His life to purchase our freedom. And He wants us to fully embrace that freedom. But what does that mean? And how do we know if we are living free?<br>Often when people hear freedom they think of external freedoms – what they can participate in, indulge in, or express. Think of how many high school graduates view starting college.&nbsp;Suddenly they move into adulthood and they think of how they can do what they want, whenever they want. They are excited they don’t have a parent looking over their shoulder or telling them what to do. And if they are not careful, at the end of their freshman year they might look back to a year of poor grades, bad choices, and many consequences to face. Why? Because they had a misconception of adulthood. Even though as an adult they have the freedom to make choices, those choices pave the way for their future.&nbsp;And while skipping class and partying may feel good at the moment, it is far from what mature adulthood should look like.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the same way, Galatians 5:13 challenges us to examine how we use our freedom. Our freedom in Christ does not mean we serve ourselves and our own purposes. It means we have a greater purpose, the purpose of knowing God’s love and sharing that love with others. While the world views freedom as self-serving, Christ’s freedom gives us a new way of living.&nbsp;Living out our freedom should be life-giving, not only to us, but to everyone we come in contact with.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>When you hear that Christ has called us to freedom, what do you think that means?<br>Do your actions reflect a self-centered and worldly freedom or do they display Christ’s freedom and love?<br>What steps do you need to take toward living out the freedom you are called to?<br><strong><br>Prayer</strong><br>Father, I know that as your child, You have called me to freedom. &nbsp;Forgive me for the times when I don’t embrace Your freedom or when I use that freedom to serve myself. &nbsp;Help me as I learn how to fully live out this calling to freedom. &nbsp;Help me to see the opportunities You give me to serve others and share Your love. &nbsp;Thank You for opening my eyes to see what freedom really means. In the name of Jesus, I pray. &nbsp;Amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.”</em>&nbsp;(Galatians 5:1 NASB)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Now He who&nbsp;establishes us with you in Christ and&nbsp;anointed us is God,&nbsp;who also&nbsp;sealed us and&nbsp;gave&nbsp;us&nbsp;the Spirit in our hearts as a&nbsp;pledge.”</em>&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 1:21-22 NASB)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I used to practice martial arts when I was younger. For the dojo that I was a part of, once you established the fundamental movements, the higher ranks would begin teaching you how to fight. But, part of learning how to fight is learning how to take a hit. You see, I was one of the smaller guys in my age group, so I was easily knocked over after taking a large blow to the head or abdomen. I’ll never forget one day, one of the best fighters in the dojo showed me how to take a hit and not be knocked down.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The key is in your stance. A wider stance with slightly bent knees creates more stability. So the lower you can get to the ground with your stance, the more stable you will be. Knowing this allowed me to stand firm in the fiercest of fights.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There are inevitably times in life when we lose our footing. It’s part of being human. Sometimes you may even feel like you’ve just been knocked down. But Paul teaches us that the solution is in your stance. Standing firm keeps us close to our foundation. And what we stand on determines how we stand. Paul reminds us in 2 Corinthians that God establishes, anoints, and seals us with Christ when we surrender our lives to Him. This is a solid foundation; a fortress for refuge; a solid rock worth standing on. (Psalm 18:2) As if that weren’t enough, He gives us the Holy Spirit in our hearts as proof that His grace is sufficient. (2 Corinthians 12:9)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The bottom line is, you are not alone in this fight. The One who is with you guarantees your freedom and victory. There is confidence and security in knowing that God has promised to come through for us. Remembering that we are promised eternity with Him gives us the strength and ability to stand firm on the rock of our salvation.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Take a moment and consider how solid the salvation of the Lord is. Think about the proof of God’s Word in your heart in the form of the Holy Spirit. Ask God to show you the reasons why you sometimes stumble or lose your stance. Pray for confidence and awareness of who God is so that you can stand firm in all circumstances.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Thank you, Father, for dying on the cross for my sins and guaranteeing that I may one day be in Your presence for eternity. Help me to stand firm in the shaky times of my life. Help me to resist the enemy and help me to push forward, beyond the darkness of this world. God, I pray that my stance would be evidence of Your power and that You would give me the strength I need to withstand temptation. In Jesus’ name I pray. Amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“Therefore, repent and return, so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord.”</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 3:19 NASB)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Can’t you see that his kindness is intended to turn you from you sin?”</em>&nbsp;(Romans 2:4b NLT)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you have ever felt regret and changed your mind, you are aware of the basis of one of the most important spiritual principles in the Bible – Repentance. &nbsp;It is the one and only way to peace.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We need to go to God and ask forgiveness, change our minds, make a 180 degree turn and go towards God’s word. &nbsp;&nbsp;Encompass it, breathe it, live it out fully. &nbsp;Repentance requires taking a new point of view;&nbsp;looking at it God’s way. God simply asks us to turn. It is a change of our heart along with behavior choices. &nbsp;It is a response of the total person, a total surrender.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We repent in our initial conversion as a Christian, but it is a constant checking of our heart condition throughout life. It is not just being sorry, or apologizing when getting caught; that’s remorse. &nbsp;In essence, anything that is not a godly response in any of our circumstances and relationships is sin. &nbsp;The sin in which we need to repent for, creates a chasm between God and us that cannot be bridged by our own human efforts. &nbsp;No matter what you have done, God has made a way home — through his Son, Jesus Christ.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>We all need to repent. &nbsp;It is ongoing. &nbsp;Things creep into our lives so subtlety. It could be something as simple as envy, control or pride. &nbsp;Ask God to show you what you might need to repent about today. &nbsp;Not only do we need to ask for forgiveness, but we also need to change our mind and heart toward contentment instead of envy, total surrender instead of control, or humility instead of pride.<br>Your heavenly Father is not looking for ways to punish you. God is just, but He is also a loving Father patiently waiting with open arms.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Precious Father, I know that I am a sinner and need Your forgiveness. &nbsp;&nbsp;Your Word says that it is Your patience and kindness that leads me to repentance. So, I come to You humbly, and confess my sin. I thank You that You forgive me by the blood of Jesus, and ask for a fresh cleansing of my body, soul and spirit. Teach me how to walk honestly before You in repentance every day. In Jesus’ name; amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“Since we are living by the Spirit, let us follow the Spirit’s leading in every part of our lives.”</em>&nbsp;(Galatians 5:25 NLT)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Growing up, I was a big USA Women’s soccer fan. I had the jersey, I read the books, I watched every game and knew all the stats. I loved the team, so I walked the walk and talked the talk. When you take an interest in something it’s quite easy to let it consume you: by the way you spend your time, thoughts, how you dress and how you speak.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But, there is a giant, flashing neon caution sign that comes with that. It’s slightly wordy, but it says, “Don’t let this have authority over your life, because what you give authority to is what you follow and start to resemble. And the only thing you need to follow and resemble, the only thing good for your soul, is the Spirit.” It’s a really big sign.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The traits we embody, the way we act, what we are shaped and make decisions by are often based on what we give authority to in our lives. For some of us it’s social media, or our career or a person in our life. Those things may resemble or even bear good fruit themselves, but God is the only source of the good fruit. He is the only good soil and steady foundation that enables us to confidently and boldly walk in love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control, and do it unshakably. He is the only source. (John 6:35) Thus, the only One worthy of having that authority in our lives. The jersey I want to wear is the one that says, “I belong to Jesus.” So I read His book and listen to His words flow through our Pastor and group leaders at church. I count the victories and blessings that God has given me and brothers and sisters in Christ.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>If we want to follow the Spirit’s leading then we need to give it authority in our lives. Is there anything that is taking authority in our lives that should be given to God?<br>Read John 6:35. Consider how Jesus as the Bread of Life relates to the Fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5:22-23.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Heavenly Father, thank You for loving us so deeply that You want to be a part of every area of our lives; and that we can trust You fully with every area. Lord, You are faithful and loving beyond our ability to comprehend. Reveal to us areas in which we need to trust You. God, give us the wisdom, courage and excitement to allow ourselves to live by and be filled by the Spirit. In Jesus’ name; amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“…And envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.”</em>&nbsp;(Galatians 5:21 NIV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“And if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him.”</em>&nbsp;(Romans 8:37 NIV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“For in Christ Jesus ‘we have obtained an inheritance,’ and have the earnest of it in our possession of the Spirit of God.”</em>&nbsp; -Charles Spurgeon</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Last summer our Bible study group went through the book The Power of God’s Names by Tony Evans. It was a phenomenal book and study, and I strongly recommend it to everyone. I had heard a few of the names of God before through scripture reading or sermons that I had listened to. Names such as Jehovah Jireh, Jehovah Rapha, Immanuel and Elohim. The book went into detail about each of these names and more to guide the reader into a deeper understanding of God’s character.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our pursuit of a relationship with God through Jesus Christ is one of developing our character while also learning more about God’s character. We desire to be more Christ-like in our thoughts and heart choices, and what better way to do that than to understand Jehovah’s true character through his names. His names tell us about who he is.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The great news is that we have become fellow heirs with Christ (Romans 8:37). Meaning that through the work and person of Jesus we are now co-heirs to the amazing power of God through his Holy Spirit. That same power of Jehovah Rapha that promised he would protect the Israelites from the diseases that struck the Egyptians is the same one that worked healing in Jesus’ name through Peter in Acts 5 when people brought the sick into the street so at least Peter’s shadow would fall on them. That same power is in us because of Jesus! It is part of our inheritance here on earth in our time here being his hands and feet.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I don’t know about you but this gets me so fired up! Not only do we share in the promise of eternity with Christ in Heaven, we share the power of God through the Holy Spirit. As hard as it is to believe in our human brains, Jesus said in John 14:12 we who believe can continue the ministry that Jesus was doing and can do even greater things because he is going to the Father! This is mind blowing, right?! All this is possible because of what he did for us. All this is accessible because of what he desires to do through us for His Kingdom. The time is now!</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection<br></strong>Do you pray specific names of God to Him when communing together? How does it feel to know we are co-heirs with Christ? How does that impact your current view of relationships?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Father, thank You for Your word that reveals Your true character! Thank You that because of grace we are saved and because of grace we are made co-heirs with Christ! Thank You that we can rest in this knowledge and settle in the promise! In Jesus’ name; amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><em><br>“But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against these things!”</em>&nbsp;(Galatians 5:22-23 NLT)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I recently decided to build a vegetable garden, except I have the unfortunate reputation of killing every plant that I pot simply because I forget to water it. I buy the plant and set it on my porch… And that’s where my gardening abilities end. I don’t know why I expect this plant to flourish and grow when I don’t water, prune or care for it.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Thankfully God is the Gardener of our hearts and never forgets about us (John 15:1). But I often find myself telling God, the Gardener, that I can water and take care of myself, expecting that I can bear good fruit on my own.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I used to think that the fruit of the Spirit was a list of good behavior for which I needed to aim. While I took it upon myself to bear fruit, I never came close to it. Just like the plant that can’t water itself, I need the Gardener to bear fruit. How do I do that? I need to die to myself (Galatians 2:20). That is because the Bible doesn’t say it is the fruit of Meg…. It says it is “the fruit of the Spirit.” God bought this disheveled plant at a high price and He wants nothing more than to water me and let me grow and bear fruit. That can’t happen if I am still clinging to my old self and my old sinful nature that made me that shriveled up plant in the first place. There isn’t room for old Meg and the Spirit in my heart. Thank goodness! Because I know how I am with plants, and I know how God is with us. Never failing, always present, perfect, God. That’s who I want to fill my heart.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Continue reading in Galatians. “Those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed the passions and desires of their sinful nature to his cross and crucified them there.” (Gal. 5:24 NLT) What parts of your old self are you clinging to and need the Spirit to fill?<br>Read Psalm 139:23 and ask God to examine your heart. What fruit do you need to ask the Lord to help you cultivate and grow?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Heavenly Father, thank You for lifting the burden from our hearts to be perfect and giving us the opportunity to be filled with our perfect Savior. I ask You to fully transform my heart and so I can be fully filled by the Spirit. Search my heart and reveal to me the parts of the old me that I still cling to so I can accept Your freedom, walk in Your freedom and live in Your freedom. In Jesus’ name: amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.” (Galatians 5:22-23 NASB)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I love the phrase at the end of Galatians 5:23, “against such things there is no law.” In other words, nothing else has the power to stop me from living out the fruit of the Spirit. Other people or external circumstances do not govern the fruit of the Spirit; it is an overflow of God’s work inside of me.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Look at joy. &nbsp;Unlike happiness, joy does not come and go based on what is occurring in my life. &nbsp;Joy is a gladness that comes because of God’s work – what He has already done, what He is doing, and what He will do in the future. &nbsp;In James 1, we are told when we face challenges, we should consider them joy. &nbsp;Why? Because we know that God is working in our lives maturing and perfecting us. &nbsp;Joy comes from an inner strength based on God’s character and is not shaken when hard times come.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the same way, God’s peace can exist during external conflict and turmoil. &nbsp;Why? The foundation for peace is not our relationship with other people, but instead our relationship with Christ (Romans 5:1). &nbsp;Peace begins with an inner tranquility between each one of us and God. &nbsp;When we have that relationship right, then our souls are rest. &nbsp;Then, that internal peace brings a calm and steadiness to our external relationships and interactions.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Because the source of the fruit of Spirit is God, we only receive it through Him and nothing and no one has the power to take it away.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Think about your current circumstances: How are you reacting the life’s challenges? &nbsp;Do you have God’s peace and joy? &nbsp;Why or why not?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>God, I am incredibly thankful for Your unshakeable joy and steadfast peace. You give me what I cannot find from anyone or anything else, which means nothing and no one can take it away from me. &nbsp;Help me to continue to walk full of Your Spirit and learn to live out of Your work in my life. &nbsp;In Jesus’ name; amen</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.”</em>(Galatians 5:22-23 NASB)<br><em>“But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared, He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,”</em>(Titus 3:4-5 NASB)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is a passage in Proverbs that says, ”If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat;And if he is thirsty, give him water to drink; For you will heap burning coals on his head,And the Lord will reward you.” (Proverbs 25:21-22) I love that because I can almost guarantee that everyone has someone in mind that needs that load upon their noggin. Part of living in a fallen world means existing with fallen people. And part of living with fallen people means getting hurt or offended.<br>Whether you tend to get angry or irritated or sad when you are hurt by other people, the Holy Spirit produces fruit that replaces dead fleshly desires. Being patient and kind towards someone who is rude and irrational seems counterintuitive and yet it’s that kindness that God can use to lead someone to repentance (Romans 2:4). Joshua Straub calls kindness “an unnatural act that comes supernaturally through the Holy Spirit.” &nbsp;But an act of kindness without the patience behind it can be just a good deed. And patience without kindness can be a cold idling. Patience and kindness must go hand in hand. So the next time someone does or says something rude to you, kindly give them a big ol’ helping of fruit (of the Spirit).</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Surely you’ve done something kind or patient recently… But what motivated that? Was it because they have been a good friend to you and you wanted to show them your appreciation? Was it because you were feeling a mood of charity and generosity? Were you just bored? Was it the Holy Spirit in you that prompted you? Take a few moments today and consider how you show kindness and patience to others. How might God develop kindness and patience in you to make you more like Jesus (Romans 8:29; 2 Corinthians 3:18)?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Lord, help me to know true kindness. Open my eyes to see more of Your kindness and patience at work around me. Help me to feel the gravity of Your kindness and patience towards me so that I might more truly reflect Your kindness and patience to others. Help me to clothe myself in kindness and patience. In Jesus’ name I pray; amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness…” (Galatians 5:22 ESV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people…” (Galatians 6:10 ESV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The saying is trustworthy, and I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to devote themselves to good works. These things are excellent and profitable for people.” (Titus 3:8 ESV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The Lord is good, a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those who trust in him.” (Nahum 1:7 ESV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear family friends recently lost their entire home to a ferocious fire. The morning after as sunshine stretched across the sky we stood in awe, staring at the smoldering aftermath. My friend had the boldness to state plainly, “This is life. But God is good.” God is good! Who knows how many times I’ve heard that phrase, but in that moment of crisis it never felt so weighty. In a circumstance when most would blame God, my friend recognized His goodness – and she meant it with every beat of her broken heart.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The goodness of God is the cornerstone of our theology. Goodness isn’t an abstract idea or human goal, it is first and foremost who God is. “For the LORD is good and his love endures forever; his faithfulness continues through all generations.” (Psalm 100:5) God reveals His goodness through what He does, creates, commands, gives, and through those who are obedient to the Holy Spirit. In fact, we have not been saved by our good works, but we have been saved for His good works! “For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.” (Ephesians 2:10)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our friends have repeatedly expressed awe over the active benevolence on their behalf. In turn, they have responded with wholehearted praise to Christ Jesus. People are left slack jawed witnessing this stunning grace in the midst of such grief. All of this goodness coming through frail humanity is evidence of God as He begins to bring beauty from the ashes. And the wild thing is, it’s touching a huge population – not only our friends’ souls, but also the hearts of those far and wide.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God’s desire is to continually feed a soul-starved world through His children in the hope that all will “Taste and see that He is good.” (Psalm 34:8) Let’s remember we’re called to do some good. The Lord’s supernatural ability is waiting to jam pack our availability!<br><strong><br>Reflect</strong><br>How have you experienced the goodness of God?<br>To whom will you demonstrate God’s goodness today? How?<br>We have a tendency to place qualities of man on God. God’s goodness is not of us. Allow the goodness of God to be God-sized in your mind.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Heavenly Father, I praise You for Your goodness all around me. Open my eyes that I may see Your good gifts in my life. Help me to yield to the Holy Spirit that others may experience Your goodness. Thank You for blessing my obedience. There is no one like You! In Jesus’ name I pray; amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest in your souls.”</em>&nbsp;(Matthew 11:29)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Read Luke 15: 11-32 on the prodigal son</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I married into a big family when I married Lauren. She has four sisters that all live locally with their families. Our newly born daughter, Hannah, was grandchild number eight for Lauren’s parents. We have six nephews ages two to seven years and one niece who is 2 years old. When they all met Hannah for the first time the most common words all of us adults would declare when holding her was, “Be Gentle!” It makes common sense to adults to be extra careful when holding a newborn baby that is so light and fragile, but for a young, energetic child it is harder to focus on being gentle.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I think about gentleness, I visualize God holding and protecting us like a newborn is held and protected. That amount of love and care is something I can only now relate to on such a small scale compared to how Christ loves and cares. &nbsp;But what is also special is how he chooses to approach me with gentleness even though it is not deserved. The unassuming approach of gentleness to me is mind blowing because of the brokenness in our hearts.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I read the passage on the prodigal son in Luke 15: 11-32, I am reminded of how God approaches the story with gentleness. The very first time I read it, I thought about the excitement and celebration that the father had when his son returned home after leaving. More recently, I have thought about the restoration between the wayward son and the father.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Today as I read it though, I saw the gentleness that was shown from the father. He received his son calmly, unashamedly and with a gentleness that shouts of something only God could do. He could have tossed him back to the pigs where he came and shouted at him to fend for himself.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The world tells us that gentleness in the face of adversity or confrontation is weak. The Greek word for gentleness is meekness, and we know that the world often views meekness as weakness. As believers though we know the truth – that gentleness is a characteristic of Christ that we have the responsibility to act out in our lives because it is extended to us daily. Jesus declares that he is gentle and humble in heart. We can practice this gentleness even in the most difficult situations because he lives in us. His reaction is gentleness first. Therefore, it can and should be ours as well.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>What does the story of the prodigal son teach you about God? Do you feel like you approach conflict with gentleness first?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Jesus, thank You for modeling gentleness. We know the world sees gentleness as weak and amusing. We know through your example that gentleness is a fruit of the Spirit. It is a recognition of Your work in us. Thank You for producing this in us and help us to fulfill this characteristic in our walk today! In Jesus’ name; amen!</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.” &nbsp;</em>(Galatians 5:22-23 NASB)<br><em>“Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful.”</em>&nbsp;(Hebrews 10:23 NASB)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What comes to your mind when you hear the word faithful? &nbsp;Thoughts might be along the line of: dedicated, steadfast, devoted, dependable, or dutiful and thorough. &nbsp;Being faithful is not always easy, is it? &nbsp;Faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control show up in the conduct and choices of our own individual Christian lives. &nbsp;It hinges upon what we value as important along with our commitment to it. Humans have a powerful tendency to be faithful to what they think is truly important. &nbsp;Being faithful is believing that God is who He says He is and not faltering even when life gets hard. &nbsp; It means we trust what God says in the Bible, and not what the world or our own eyes tell us. We are not called to be successful, we are called to be faithful. &nbsp;We are to be faithful to our Lord with the gifts, abilities and opportunities He gives us and we need to leave the results to Him. &nbsp;Being constantly faithful can be difficult at times, because temptations are all around us. But we must make conscious choices to follow God.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God is always faithful to us, even when we are not faithful to Him. He is always by our side, even when we do not seek Him or even notice He is there. He always keeps his promises. &nbsp; When our son was a senior in high school we found out he had cancer. &nbsp;God prompting our church family to rally around us will always be etched in our minds and hearts. &nbsp;His faithfulness to us in our time of need gave us the peace and comfort we so desperately needed. &nbsp;“Your lovingkindness, O Lord, extends to the heavens, your faithfulness reaches to the skies.” (Psalm 6:5 NASB) &nbsp;The full extent of our influence through faithfulness may not always be known to human eyes, but always to God.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection<br></strong>Take a little time to sit quietly before God and ask Him:<br>– Show us areas we need to improve in our faithfulness.<br>– How faithful are we behind closed doors, when no one else can see or know our choices?<br>– Do we tend to “take things back” when life gets tough, or stand firm and faithful?<br>– What is it that we value as important enough in our lives to be completely faithful?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Dear Father, thank You for being our greatest example of faithfulness. Teach us to be more like You, giving us ways to demonstrate our faithfulness to You and others. Help us identify the temptations that may take us away from You. Give us strength to remain faithful, even in the most trying and difficult moments of our lives. Thank You, Jesus, for Your loving care toward us. &nbsp;In Your precious name, amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On February 3rd we are going to have our first ever Women’s Event at The Point, called Chosen. We have been planning, praying, and preparing for this incredible time together. We are so excited to have an awesome time of teaching, worship, prayer, and connecting among women!</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In Ephesians 1:3 and 4, scripture states, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him.” This is our theme verse for Chosen. We were created to worship our God and Savior, and live a life that glorifies only Him. As we journey through Ephesians we are going to discover how we were Chosen in Him before the foundation of the world. We are going to realize our identity and who we are in Christ. And then we are going to be overwhelmed by the goodness of God, his love, mercy and grace. How we were all born into sin, but God intervened and made a way through Jesus Christ for each and every one of us!</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I cannot tell you how excited I am for this event; for how God is going to work and move through hearts and change lives because of His Word being brought to every woman that gathers together on February 3rd. Through our time of prayer, worship, time in The Word, and connecting with one another we are going to grow together and discover the blessings we have in and through Christ!</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I want to encourage each woman to attend this incredible day with us. We all need encouragement and fellowship with other women. We all need time to be together in worship and teaching and prayer. Make it a priority to attend this day; you will not be disappointed! Come expectant for how God is going to work and move in your own heart and life. Bring someone with you that needs to experience the goodness, love, grace, and mercy of God! We have been Chosen through Christ. We all need to be refreshed and come face to face with His love, compelling all of us to life change. I am praying for each one of you and believing that God has new things in store for all of you in this New Year! He has Chosen you and He has great things prepared for you. Remember, You are loved and You are Chosen!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This week we are teaming with the Pregnancy Centers of Central VA.&nbsp;Today’s blog is written by&nbsp;Jillian Miller, the Center Director for Albemarle County.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br>“For in him we live and move and have our being…” (Acts 17:28)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Life is a beautiful thing. It has its fair share of struggles, pain and hardship, but it is a gift. A gift which can be filled with the most precious things if our hearts are open to them: love, joy, faith, family, friendships, laughter, hope and peace. These are the things that make the struggles bearable, that ease the pain and bring hope to the hardship.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As Christians we also believe that every life is created by God, and precious to Him. We don’t exist by happenstance, but by a plan and for a purpose of the ever-knowing, ever-living God. Which is why here at the Pregnancy Centers we are called to stand up for this most precious gift. We speak for the preborn who cannot speak for themselves. We embrace women and men pressured to consider abortion. These most vulnerable need us, the body of Christ, to support them in their hour of need, to speak truth to them that the culture will not, and to give them hope when they feel hopeless. But we cannot do this work alone.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We have been so blessed by the support and partnership of The Point over the past several years. In 2015 your first diaper drive spring-boarded our diaper ministry. We are now able to offer almost 1,000 packs of diapers a year to our clients who come to us in need! We are also grateful to have been a chosen charity for The Point service days and Reach events. Your church’s involvement sustains us and reminds us that we are united in Christ, and we are so thankful. Today, we are going to step out and ask even more of you…</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is a new program born out of the Pregnancy Center movement for churches called Life Disciples. The program asks supporting churches to become a safe haven for women in unplanned pregnancies. You see, Christians are not immune to abortion. Women sitting next to you on Sundays, listening to Pastor Gabe preach, volunteering, working, going to school, just like you, may be overwhelmed with what a pregnancy will do to their lives. The plans it will change. The challenges it will bring. The people it will affect. Unfortunately, she may also worry, “What will my church think of me?”. And the fear of that shame (real or imagined) may be enough to drive her to an abortion clinic. We want to believe as Christians we would always choose life, but sometimes it’s not that simple.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Will you help support life in a brand new way by becoming&nbsp;<strong>Life Disciples</strong>? Not for the Pregnancy Center, but for anyone in your church who might soon face this difficult situation. Support changes things. You can change things. Whether it’s this year, or in 5 years, it will happen to someone there. Will you be there to stand by them in this powerful way?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>How do I feel about helping someone facing an unplanned pregnancy? Is God calling me to do more to protect and promote the sanctity of human life in my own church?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Heavenly Father, you are the Father of all the living. Today I thank you for the gift of life. I pray for the protection of every life you have created – from conception to natural death. I pray for healing for all the men and women who have experienced abortion, especially within our church family. May they know intimately the peace and hope found in the ocean of Your mercy. May our church truly be a beacon of light for anyone within our congregation facing pregnancy. May they know they will be supported and loved here. And may we have the strength and wisdom to come alongside them when they need us the most. In the name of Jesus Christ I pray, Amen.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For more information, contact Jenny Basile at The Pregnancy Centers,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:jenny@virginiapregnancy.org">jenny@virginiapregnancy.org</a>&nbsp;or 434.9794516. And thank you again for all that you do.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Today’s blog is written by April Stumme, an author at World Help.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.” (John 15:12)</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Bible is full of commands to love in a big way. We are called to generosity and passion that helps people discover the revolutionary love of Jesus. One village in Guatemala was introduced to that love because of you.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As a church, The Point chose to love the village of Curva Del Pino, Guatemala. Because of your generosity toward The Village Project, this community now has resources and tools that will transform lives for generations to come. Children were blessed with a new school building with electricity, school bathrooms, and a playground with a basketball court. Families were blessed with food, fruit trees to provide reliable income, clean water, and sturdy homes. And the community was blessed with a church building and Bibles.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Your generosity also provided the local pastor with a new home and the support to continue ministering to the village and telling people about the Good News of Jesus Christ. But transforming a village isn’t the only way you’ve loved those in need. You’ve sent relief to hurricane victims. You’ve provided Bibles for Iraqi refugees. And you’ve transformed another village in Cuba.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">World Help has a mission to provide help for today and hope for tomorrow to those in need, and The Point is doing exactly that. World Help is a Christian humanitarian organization serving the physical and spiritual needs of people in impoverished communities around the world. For the past 26 years they have been devoted to meeting the needs of the whole person — both physically and spiritually.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">By sending relief, food, education, and more, you are providing help. And your gifts of a church, Bibles, and pastor support are reaping a hope that will never die. God showed us incredible love by sending His Son to give us eternal life. And you are reflecting that same magnificent love to people in need.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">From Charlottesville to Guatemala to Cuba and beyond, you are reaching the world for Christ; you are giving people a better future and the chance to learn about a Savior who can transform their lives for eternity. We are so thankful for our partnership with you and that the people of The Point have such generous hearts to give another suffering person a brighter future.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To learn more about World Help or to get involved, check out http://worldhelp.net/impact/</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Each New Year is filled with hope and promise for a better year than the last. “This year I’m going to eat right and get healthy.” “This year is going to be the year that I get organized.” “This is the year I’m going to take that trip I’ve been wanting to go on.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As a church, we are gearing up for an incredible 2018 filled with new and exciting things planned to move our mission and vision forward. You’ll often hear Pastor Gabe say that, “any vision that doesn’t include reaching the world is too small.” Our vision is that in our first&nbsp;<strong>50 years</strong>&nbsp;as a church, we will REACH:&nbsp;<strong>50 communities</strong>&nbsp;in our city and region with ongoing multiplying small groups,&nbsp;<strong>50 cities</strong>&nbsp;in our nation with church plants that we have sent, and&nbsp;<strong>50 countries</strong>&nbsp;in the world that we have reached where we have ongoing partnerships.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Currently at The Point, we have over 40 small groups in our area and region. That is 40+ biblical communities meeting weekly to study the Word of God and sharing the Gospel with their friends, family, co-workers, and neighbors. We also have monthly REACH projects in which the entire church and community is invited to come and serve our city and region together! We are partnering with organizations like PACEM, which organizes shelters and activities for the homeless in the winter, Camp Holiday Trails, which serves the special needs community, Salvation Army, Habitat for Humanity, The Toy Lift, and more! We also partner directly with our Charlottesville city offices on projects as well. Internationally, we are sending teams to 4 different countries: Guatemala, Cuba, the Philippines, and Nicaragua. We will be exploring the opportunity to expand that REACH to Liberia this year as well. The Lord has opened so many doors of ministry already both locally and internationally for our church!</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To make it a little more personal for you, in Matthew 28 the Lord called each of us to “go and make disciples of ALL nations.” Whether that is right here in your community or across the world in the Philippines, He has called each of us to share the love of Christ with all that will hear. While I might have some of the same New Year’s resolutions as others reading this, I think we could all add one more – to GO and make disciples with more intentionality and purpose than ever before. Some might be thinking about sharing your testimony, the Romans Road, walking someone through the complete Gospel story, etc. However, I’m talking about sharing the love of Christ in every situation big and small to hopefully lead to that greater conversation. I want to have more patience, show more grace, give joy, speak life, gain wisdom, and so much more. “Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom,” Psalm 90:12. We don’t have the time or luxury to hope that we bump into a few Gospel conversations this year. Get involved in a small group, come to REACH projects, or go on a mission trip! Make the most of every moment by making it a moment that will have an eternal impact.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Today’s blog is written by April Meyer. Read as she shares how God called her family to Charlottesville and to be a part of the Point!</em><br><br>Our family started attending The Point in the fall of 2009, but the journey to the church began the year before. While living in Chesapeake, Virginia, God filled our lives with a wonderful community of family and friends, a church that encouraged spiritual growth, great jobs and a home we imagined growing our family in. Surprisingly, we started sensing God drawing us away from the area and after months of praying we knew God was calling us to Charlottesville. It felt like we were being exiled from everything that was secure.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">During this time, I asked God, “Why” a lot. Thankfully, God responded through Jeremiah 29 especially verse 11. This didn’t change the extent of what He was asking but allowed us to see that it wasn’t for our discomfort but to build His future kingdom; and that we needed to walk through this move with hope.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As God was placing the move on our hearts, He was doing the same with our friends &amp; church. We learned that a team was preparing to plant a church in Charlottesville, and we were thrilled! We wouldn’t have to look for friends or a church because we would move with our community. The team transitioned to Richmond, VA to begin training under a sister church.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">During this time, Phillip and I started our own business which was another answer to prayer. God began sending us clients from Charlottesville that gave Phillip the opportunity to get to know the area and he was thrilled to be so close to the Mountains. We were at peace with the calling to help plant a church in Charlottesville.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Unfortunately, as we made plans to move to Charlottesville, we learned the church decided to send the team to Fredericksburg, VA. Again, I asked God, “Why?” Have we heard you wrong? Are we supposed to move to Fredericksburg? We continued praying and seeking direction.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They began regular meetings in Fredericksburg to build community with a group of locals. We joined a meeting and left feeling very sad. It was evident to us that we were no longer going to be part of this church plant. It felt as if the wind had been taken from our sails and we were drifting along wondering what we should do. Had we heard God wrong?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God made it clear that we were on the right path by bringing me back to Jeremiah 29:11. So we moved to Charlottesville in August of 2009. We understood the importance of having community and hungered for a church family. Therefore, we started the search with a well-established church but found it hard to plug in. After attending a few times, I was feeling very lonely and not sure what to do next. On one specific day, I was running errands and missing a girlfriend to shop with. During the ride home, I sought direction on the next church we should try. The loneliness and the need to be with God among his people was an overwhelming feeling. I needed community. I needed a church.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I arrived home, there was a flyer hanging on the doorknob for a new church called The Point. We visited the very next Sunday and met Pastor Gabe. While the attendance was small, the people were friendly, and the teaching was insightful. When we went back the next week Pastor Gabe remembered our names and that sealed the deal, we were home. We jumped right in attending two community groups and learning where we could begin serving. We were supposed to move to Charlottesville to help plant a church, The Point!</p>

      <title>Goodbye Old Me</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2018/10/2/goodbye-old-me</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Today’s blog is written by Niki Willis. Read as she shares how to walk as new creation and to surrender our ways to God’s when we deal with conflict.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“Everything—and I do mean everything—connected with that old way of life has to go. It’s rotten through and through. Get rid of it! And then take an entirely new way of life—a God-fashioned life, a life renewed from the inside and working itself into your conduct as God accurately reproduces His character in you.”<br>-Ephesians 4:22-24 MSG</em></p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So, you read the title—possibly intrigued, but pretty confident that you know what’s coming next. But do you really? In our current series,&nbsp;<em>My Way</em>, Pastor Gabe is teaching on conflict. I want to be upfront and honest and say that my biggest source of conflict, a majority of the time, is me. When my desires become more important than the needs of others, when I am offended because someone said something that struck a nerve deep down revealing something about myself and I become defensive, I find conflict. Do you see where I’m going with this? Can you see how I can be a source of conflict for myself? Ephesians 4:22-24 and I have become inseparable. I must choose to die to myself daily, and, just being real, it may be many times a day.<br>You see, conflict means a state of opposition. It means to come into collision or disagreement—a controversy or argument. All the definitions mentioned are points of entry for the enemy when conflict is not handled God’s way. Because I live to serve Jesus, to model Him, and to know more of Him, I can’t afford cracks that allow the enemy to get into my heart and mind. So where does it start? Right with me! There will be conflict, but the key is to not allow conflict to have us. Throughout my life, I have tried fighting back. I tend to be a bit rebellious (I think), but that escalates and keeps the anger raging. When I tried to avoid the conflict, resentment began to fester in my mind and it became bigger than it actually was. Those tactics gave the enemy permission to whisper lies that were not there before! I say&nbsp;<em>thank you Jesus!</em>&nbsp;as I write to you now, this very second, I can boldly declare&nbsp;<em>goodbye old me!</em></p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So now you have the skinny on the old me. Well, a little of it. But let me tell you what Jesus is doing in me now! I practice, practice, and practice more of something that has changed me from the inside out. Here it is… You ready?&nbsp;<strong>Assuming the best in others and assuming the best in all situations.</strong>Sounds simple you might say to yourself, but it is not, look for the good! It is hard for the enemy to twist your perspective when you look for the good.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I ask the Holy Spirit to be the voice I hear the loudest. I ask Him to reveal to me when I am in “me” mode, so I can get out of my own line of fire. I ask Him to lead me to Him first, rather than running to someone I know that will jump on the bandwagon with me. I ask Him to place people in my life that can speak life into me, that can speak love and truth to me, that will keep me aligned vertically. I ask Him to help me to forgive because I know He forgave me. I want to view life from God’s perspective. I want His presence in my heart. I want more of Him and less of me. In order for that to happen for us, we have to say goodbye to the old US! I have by no means mastered this, but I do know that my goal in conflict is unity, and unity poses a threat to the enemy. We have to be in God’s Word to continue moving forward. We need to make the choice to surrender, surrender, surrender, and then surrender again—to say<em>&nbsp;goodbye&nbsp;</em>to the&nbsp;<em>old me</em>.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Think about this:<br>We boldly declare these words to Him in our worship:&nbsp;<em>“If You gladly chose surrender so will I.”</em>&nbsp;But will you? Will you surrender your way, your right, and your wants when conflict arises? Will you own your part? Will you hear with an open heart? Loving people matters more than being right or being heard.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><em>“Our love for others is our grateful response to the love God first demonstrated to us.”<br>-1 John 4:19</em></p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Challenge:<br>Pray Ephesians 4:22-24 over yourself, memorize Ephesians 4:22-24 and speak it over your life, time and time again. Say goodbye to the old you and hello to the new creation you are in Him!</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Written by&nbsp;Kristin Fields</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison.” -Matthew 5:23-25</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A couple weeks ago my daughter and I were experiencing a typical power struggle over blessed earbuds on our way to church. Tempted to march myself into the service with a smile plastered over my pout, I paused. I remembered Jesus’ words telling us to stop when we’re about to worship and first, make things right with a brother who has something against us. In fact, the next verse emphasizes that we should “come to terms quickly with your accuser” or else you could end up in some serious bondage. That Sunday I quickly passed friends and coffee in the lobby to find my girl and ask forgiveness for my part in our argument.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When you deal with conflict the way Jesus taught, you are sowing obedience to His Word and will reap the fruit of His Spirit.&nbsp;<em>This fruit is evidence of His Presence: “love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.” -Galatians 5:22-23</em>. As I read this list, self-control stands out as a bit of an oddball, but maybe that’s because of its unique purpose. Could it be that self-control is the pause button that allows us to experience Jesus’ nature? When we pause, the Holy Spirit can empower us to think with the mind of Christ and live out His ways. When we pause, the healing Presence of God can be experienced by you and given to others. When we pause, it’s the beginning of peace. There is no spiritual law that can overcome God’s ways – including a teenager with earbuds!&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>The grace given to you when you pause in conflict is not just to make you feel better. It is for the purpose of displaying Christ’s nature and to minister His love to others. How are you being led to obey and display God in your situation?&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Loving Father, thank You for the wisdom You have given me in Your Word. Please empower me to pause in my situation and take a step of obedience in Your ways. I pray for Your Presence to be experienced as I humble myself. Help me to partner with You in my circumstances. It’s in the powerful name of Jesus Christ that I pray, amen.</p>

      <title>Conflict</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2018/10/30/conflict</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Today’s blog is written by Allison Poindexter.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the Lord.” And Nathan said to David, “The Lord also has put away your sin; you shall not die. Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the Lord, the child who is born to you shall die.”<br>-2 Samuel 12:13-14</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I was a child, I occasionally attended Sunday school with an aunt when I would stay overnight at her house. The trouble with attending Sunday school irregularly is that I got a somewhat irregular education about famed Bible characters. I remember learning about Bible characters like they were superheroes. I saw illustrations of Moses, staff in hand, standing before the parted Red Sea. I saw Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego huddled together with flames surrounding them but never hurting them. And I saw the child David, clutching a slingshot, ready to battle the terrifying Goliath. What I didn’t understand then was that the real superhero of these scenarios was God, protecting each of these characters from trouble.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The trouble with assigning superhero status to a character like David is that I ignored the most important part of his story.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">King David’s life is rich with evidence of conflict. As a child, he defeated Goliath with just a stone, as I had seen in my Sunday school lesson. He endured the jealous, irrational King Saul to eventually become King of Israel. He fought countless battles to deliver nations into the hands of the nation of Israel. If we could put just those conflicts into a neat little box, David’s story would be one of triumph in the service of God. However, David’s story is much more complicated, and as a result, we are blessed with an example, a man after God’s own heart, who struggled with conflict and sin just like we do.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What we learn from David is that sometimes our conflict is really a conflict with and a sin against God. At the beginning of 2 Samuel 11, when the rest of Israel was at war, King David stayed in Jerusalem. While David was at home, he found himself in conflict. I’m not sure what caused David to even look upon Bathsheba, but the results were disastrous: adultery, betrayal, murder, and ultimately, infant death.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Sunday school version of David certainly left out that this superhero warrior had committed adultery with a woman and killed her husband to cover it up. But I’m so grateful for the damaged, broken, and authentic David we read about in scripture, because when THAT David was confronted with his sins, he responded simply with “I have sinned against the Lord.” We have a record of the true David’s life and songs to forever provide wisdom as we encounter the conflicts in our lives, and the response we should give when we’re confronted with the ways we’ve sinned against God. We learn from David that our God is endlessly merciful and conflict does not disqualify us from a life of service to God.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Is there a conflict in your life that you need to repent of? What lesson can we take from David about how to repent?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Lord, I am so thankful for your mercy in light of my mistakes. Be with me so that I’m making choices that are honoring to you. I pray David’s prayer in Psalm 51:&nbsp;<em>“Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.” (Verse 10)</em></p>

      <title>Take a Look Inside</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2018/10/8/take-a-look-inside</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have you ever been a part of a toxic environment? The kind that is full of fighting, gossip, anger, and backbiting? It could be a workplace, a team, or even your home. We have all experienced them. These types of places seem to pull people in and wrap them up in drama.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we are surrounded by unhealthy behavior it is very easy to be sucked right into it. It is also easy to blame our own behavior on the situation, the environment, or the actions of others. This kind of thinking is exactly what James addresses when he writes to the early church. In chapter 4, James begins with this question,&nbsp;<em>“What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you?”&nbsp;</em>Then he gives an answer that probably surprised his readers,&nbsp;<em>“Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you? You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask. You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrongly, to spend it on your own passions.” -James 4:1-3 ESV</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How do you react when you find yourself in the middle of negativity or conflict? Do you run away? Do you blame others? Do you blow up? Or do you solve it?&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">James makes it really clear, when you are involved in fighting and quarreling it is a reflection of what is going on inside you. In other words, you cannot blame the conflict on anyone else. If you are personally engaged in the fight, it is because you are personally unhealthy. It is much easier to find someone to blame, but our strong reactions, pointed words, and rude behavior are not present because of what someone else has done or said.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As a teenager, I remember hearing my pastor explain that our reactions are solely our responsibility. No one can provoke any behavior out of me that I am not in control of. He compared it to an orange. If you squeeze an orange what will come out? Only orange juice because that is what is already inside. When life “squeezes” you, or the people in your life “squeeze” you, that will only produce what is already inside of you.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In college, one of my jobs was in what I would consider a toxic environment. People didn’t trust each other, in fact, at one point the board fired the director. It seemed everyone had something to say and most of it was very negative. I found all too quickly I would get pulled into the talk about who said what and who did what. But in the middle of all of this, I remember one lady who stood out. She always had kinds words to say. I never heard her slander anyone or join in the chatter. To this day, anytime I think of positive speech, she is one of the first people that comes to mind. Despite the negative surroundings, she was able to remain positive and joyful. Why? I believe it was because her heart was right. Inside she was full of God so that is what overflowed from her life.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Next time you find yourself engrossed in conflict, take some time to check your heart. Use James 4 as a guide to ask a few questions, such as:<br>● What is my motivation for engaging in this argument?<br>● Why is this bothering me so much?<br>● What unrealistic expectations do I have?<br>● Why do I have so much to say about this?<br>● What is it that I want to gain out of this situation?<br>● Is there anything on my mind that I need to bring to God?<br>● What is shaping my negative thinking?<br>● What can I learn about myself through this?<br>● How can I grow closer to God through this?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you keep reading in James 4, James gives us some encouragement,&nbsp;<em>“[God] gives more grace. Therefore, it says, ‘God opposes the proud but gives to the humble.’ Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.” -James 4:6-7</em>&nbsp;When you find yourself involved in conflict don’t look around you. Instead, even though it might be painful, look inside your heart and look up to God for healing. When you do, you will find that God is full of grace. He will bring healing. And He will give you the strength to overcome.</p>

Read as she shares about how preparing and delivering meals are practical ways to communicate care and God’s love to our church family.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“I give you a new command: Love one another. Just as I have loved you, you are also to love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”<br>–John 13:34-35</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Food is my love language. Yes, I know it doesn’t make the list made popular by the famous book by Gary Chapman. We’ve all taken the assessments and should find ourselves in one of the five categories:</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">• Words of affirmation<br>• Quality time<br>• Receiving gifts<br>• Acts of service<br>• Physical touch</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But for me, nothing I do compares to the overwhelming satisfaction I get when I cook for someone, have fellowship with friends, or plan our meals. Even grocery shopping makes me smile.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">No matter what our cultural background is, the preparation and eating of food is something we all have in common with one another. And it is in the sharing of food with others that keeps us connected.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A quick biblical search on the topic of sharing food and hospitality will produce hundreds of verses. In some of the most memorable stories of Jesus, presented to us, we are reminded that he also saw the importance of these two things.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.”<br>-Revelation 3:20</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Share with God’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality.”<br>-Romans 12:13</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the fast-paced, tech-saturated, attention-deficit-disordered culture in which we find ourselves, Christians need to recover the art of a slow meal around a table with people we care about. Can’t we all agree some of our best childhood memories include food? The Thanksgiving dinners when all of the extended family traveled to be together, those birthdays where mom cooked our favorite meal, or the summers spent gathered together in the backyard with the smell of the charcoal grill nearby. Food simply brings people together.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am proud to serve on The Care Team at The Point, where we listen, pray and encourage everyone in our church family. I have been blessed with the task of chairing our “Meals Team”. Did you know that our church provides hot, home cooked meals to people in need, including new parents, and those recovering from surgeries or medical issues? We absolutely do! When I arrived at The Point, my first meal delivery was a simple one, Loaded Potato Soup and a sleeve of crackers. Seriously, I could make that with my eyes closed. But you know what? The recipient of that soup still to this day talks to me about our visit. Just last week as I walked out towards my car she shouted, “Hey, do I have to get sick again to get some more of that soup!” Food is my love language, and she’ll be getting a pot of soup from me very soon!</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Thank You Lord for calling us into fellowship with Yourself and others. Thank you for your blessings of food, friends, and family. Help us to love one another as you have commanded and bless our time together always. Amen</p>

      <title>Attitude of Gratitude</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2018/11/19/attitude-of-gratitude</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Today’s blog is written by Angela Shakelford. Read as she shares about the power of gratitude.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Come, let us sing for joy to the Lord; let us shout to the rock of our salvation. Let us come before him with thanksgiving and extol him with music and song.”<br>-Psalm 95:1-2</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Imagine the scene on Christmas morning. Everyone is gathered around the Christmas tree and the gifts are being distributed. There are two children present. The first child reacts with gratitude to everything they receive, even if they already have one or an item doesn’t quite fit right. The second child is difficult to please and nothing is quite right. There is a complaint, groan or face for everything received.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Which child enjoys Christmas most? The first child surely does because attitude makes all the difference – and this is true every day of the year, not just on Christmas morning. The Christmas morning example is like a snapshot of life. Some are thankful, and others continuously dwell on the negative.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we are able to see life through a lens of gratitude, we are looking at it through the eyes of faith, trusting that God will see us through and provide. Renowned Bible teacher Chuck Swindoll says, “I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I react to it. And so, it is with you…we are in charge of our attitudes.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It can become easy to slip into the trap of thinking or behaving like the second child at Christmas. The Bible teaches us through scripture over and over that we are to sing for joy and come before Him with Thanksgiving. On days when joy and thanksgiving is not my first reaction, no one can convict me of negative attitude more than Paul. He wrote from the confines of a prison cell, a lesson for us to “Give thanks in all circumstances.” -1 Thessalonians 5:18</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Stop and think of 5 things in your life you are thankful for right now. Did it feel good? Could you keep going? How might it change your days to approach life with this attitude of gratitude?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Loving God, We turn our hearts to you, reminded that every gift we have was provided by you. For each gift, we are grateful. For each gift you have provided, we see the abundance of your love. We praise and rejoice in You. We give You thanks and praise.</p>

      <title>Gratitude: The Pursuit</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2018/11/26/gratitude-the-pursuit</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Today’s blog is written by Jonathan Hickory. Read as he shares about how God pursues us as children and what it means to be a child of God.&nbsp;<br><br>My beloved son turns two years old in a few days. Lately, he loves to play a game with me where he will run tirelessly through the endless grass in our backyard, looking back to see if I am running after him. He has no direction, he has no destination, but he knows he is running from me. To his delight, I pursue him, his little legs moving as fast as they can while my pace remains even, steady, and unwavering.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Chase me, Daddy! Chase me!” he giggles with glee as his blonde hair reflects the warm sunlight. As he looks backwards, sometimes he stumbles and sometimes he tumbles, only to have me leap on top of him and sweep him up into my arms, embracing him with unsurpassable joy and endless love. We laugh together and I find myself overjoyed to share in his laughter and wonder.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How often do we, as children of God, run from our Heavenly Father? How often do we pursue worldly things—money, family, success, prideful ambitions, lust, greed, addictions—instead of pursuing our Creator? Though we do not realize it, as we pursue these things as a priority over our faith, we wander and we wonder, as God continues to lovingly pursue our hearts.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How can we begin to understand this pursuit? Why would God waste His time with a heart that is not only pursuing worldly meaninglessness, but often times running from Him at the same time? Let’s take a moment to explore God’s desire for His children.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You are created in God’s image — YOU are one of God’s children!&nbsp;<em>“God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.” -Genesis 1:27</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Just as we love our children, God loves His children dearly and He desperately wants a close relationship with you. Jesus said,&nbsp;<em>“What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray? And if he finds it, truly, I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray. So it is not the will of my Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.” -Matthew 18:12-14</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our vulnerable young children trust their parents and they seek their father for protection from the dark and the dangers of the world — the nightmare, the vicious snarling dog, and crossing the busy street safely. God wants you to trust fully in Him and seek Him for protection from evil.&nbsp;<em>“The sun shall not strike you by day, nor the moon by night. The LORD will keep you from all evil; he will keep your life.” -Psalm 121:6-7</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our children rely on us for provision of food, clothing, and shelter. God wants you to trust in Him for provision; He will faithfully provide for you! Jesus said,&nbsp;<em>“Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.” -Matthew 10:29-31</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our children need and love their father, desiring relationship with him, just as you need Jesus in your heart in order to seek a genuine relationship with God.&nbsp;<em>“You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart.” -Jeremiah 29:13</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Just as we want the very best for our children, yet know the value of discipline, God wants the very best for His children, and will lovingly discipline when needed.&nbsp;<em>“And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons? ‘My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved by him. For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives.’ It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live? For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness. For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it. -Hebrews 12:5-11</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have you ever thought about your relationship with God in this way? Your relationship with God is not a friendship, it is not a mutually beneficial business relationship, and it is not an arrangement where you get to call the shots — you are a child of our Sovereign God and you are created in His image. He is a good Father and He wants what is best for&nbsp;<strong>His children</strong>&nbsp;— that’s you and me! But a good and loving Father will also lovingly pursue and discipline the wayward child.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>God’s pursuit of our hearts is something I am incredibly grateful for. If God had not pursued you, where would you be right now? Have you ever looked back on the hard times in your life, the times before you were walking with the Lord—and realized how He was chasing after you, yearning to sweep you into His arms and embrace you? Are you walking with God, and is He convicting your heart to draw you closer to Him? Or are you still running from Him? If you are not seeking God every day with every facet of your life, you better believe He is pursuing you. If you once were one of His lost sheep and the Good Shepherd found you, praise Him today and forevermore!</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Almighty Father, You are our Good Father, and I am grateful for your pursuit of my heart. Lord, guide my path and help me to seek you first in all that I do, in all that I am. Thank you for loving me as your child, created in your holy image.</p>

      <title>Discouragement &amp;amp; Hope</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2018/11/5/discouragement-amp-hope</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Today’s blog is written by Bonnie Russman. Read as she shares what to do when we are discouraged.<br><br><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction, that through perseverance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.”<br>-Romans 15:4 – NASB</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have you ever been discouraged? Each of us has probably experienced some form of discouragement at one time or another; I certainly have. We’ve all felt sad, let down or disappointed, but true discouragement goes deeper than mere surface feelings. The dictionary defines discouragement as the loss of confidence or courage – to be disheartened. True discouragement is in many ways akin to a broken heart.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As Christ followers, we know that He dwells in our hearts, along with our own faith in Him, and hope, and love. And if the joy of the Lord is our strength, how could a child of God lose these precious gifts and give way to discouragement? Sometimes we forget, for a moment, that our powerful, loving, faithful God is with us and in us, and our eyes focus instead on our own issues that appear shrouded in hopelessness. We allow ourselves to believe that the moment or season we currently endure is our reality, and we turn inward, enduring it alone and believing the lie – tempted to give in to despair.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In my own life, such times might have overwhelmed me had it not been for the Word of God. He alone has the words of eternal life, and there is hope in Him. He heals the brokenhearted. His written Word is truth – our actual reality – and scripture is where we must always turn in our time of greatest need.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For as long as my season of discouragement lasts, God tells me through His Word that He is with me and will never leave me, and that waiting on Him brings strength. He assures me of ultimate victory because He is in me and has already won the battle and overcome the world. He reminds me that I am loved, cherished, and valued no matter how I might feel. He promises that when I turn to Him, He will turn to me – period. Indeed, the Word of God is my precious hiding place, my strong tower where I can run and be safe, the lamp that lights my path, the unshakeable truth that is forever settled in heaven; my teacher, my mirror, my constant companion, and my miracle of salvation.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br><em>“Remember the word to Thy servant, in which thou has made me hope.”<br>-Psalm 119:49</em><br>No matter what you may be going through today, God’s Word can help! Plunge yourself into that wonderful source of life-giving truth without delay and let hope and healing come into your heart. Know for sure, all that you are and all that you have in Him. Ponder these things, hide them in your heart, persevere, and you will know the meaning of “the encouragement of the scriptures!”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Dear Father, I am so very thankful for your Word, for its power and truth, and for the gifts and promises that are available to me there. Open my heart and mind and make me worthy to receive you, O Lord. Only say the word and I shall be healed.</p>

      <title>15 Minutes to Flee</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2018/12/19/15-minutes-to-flee</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Imagine sitting at home on a relaxing December evening before the warmth of your fireplace. It’s cold outside. You’re watching your favorite Christmas special. Your children are playing on the floor in the light of your Christmas tree. In the chaos of your life and the Christmas season, everything seems calm and right in the world, even if it’s just for that evening.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Suddenly the peace and quiet get interrupted with a phone call. It’s a warning that there is an army approaching your community and you have 15 minutes to flee. It’s a high likelihood that if you’re there when the army arrives, you and your sons will be tortured and killed, and your wife and daughters will be raped. What do you take with you? What gets left behind?&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">While it’s hard for us to imagine a scenario this tragic and disturbing, this is the reality of many Syrian and Iraqi refugees who were forced to leave their war-torn countries finding refuge in Jordan from both Isis and other fighting armies.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The week after Thanksgiving I had the opportunity to visit Jordan and specifically the region bordering the Syrian and Iraqi borders, where refugee camps are sprinkled throughout the desert side. As we were invited into the makeshift homes; tents with siding and roofs constructed of plastic tarps and sheets, we heard story after story like the one above. While these people once lived very comfortably, the only thing that they now possess is what they were able to gather and carry from their home in that 15-minute window.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We cannot change the circumstances of their past, but we can offer the hope and healing of Jesus for their future. We can provide blankets and heaters for their cold winter, food and other humanitarian aid in their hunger, and informal education for their children. And in sharing the love of Jesus in practical ways, thousands of these refugees are turning to Jesus and becoming followers of Him.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is God’s redemptive story that we have been invited to be a part of in Jordan, Syria and Iraq. We have that same invitation in other nations of the world as well, and while not every country and need look the same, sharing the love of Jesus in practical ways is always the answer.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Below are our partners and a brief picture of how we have been able to REACH these nations with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Thank you for your generosity and your prayers which accelerate the vision God has given us. Please pray about going on one of our short-term mission trips and being the hands and feet of Jesus in the field.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>REACH Cuba – Go and Tell Ministries</strong><br>Go and Tell Ministries is focused on reaching the people of Cuba through outreach, evangelism, discipleship, and humanitarian aid. The Point has an historic partnership with Go and Tell to build a ministry center in the community of Los Pinos, a suburb of Havana.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Over the past few years we have sent seven teams to assist in church and outreach ministry as they prepare to break ground on the ministry center in the near future.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>REACH Guatemala – Hope of Life&nbsp;</strong><br>Hope of Life’s vision is to rescue the future generations of Guatemala and the world through the power of a practical gospel. Working with Hope of Life, The Point has completed the village transformation of Curva del Pino and has adopted the village of Timiluya, located in the mountains of Guatemala. Most people in Timiluya live in extreme poverty and make their living through agriculture. In 2018 we have completed much needed repairs on the school in this new village.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>REACH Liberia – Petals of Hope&nbsp;</strong><br>Petals of Hope supports impoverished girls, families, and communities for Christ by creating opportunities for holistic education and establishing safe houses for victims of gender-based violence and trafficking. The Point partners with Petals of Hope through supporting and helping with the expansion of the girl’s academy.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>REACH Mexico – Seedtime and Harvest&nbsp;</strong><br>Seedtime and Harvest is based on evangelizing the “lower end” of society – those who live as outcasts due to their addictions, cartel work, or abandonment by absent parents. These people are won through rehab centers, soccer programs, education programs, and social assistance. The Point partners with Seedtime and Harvest to support pastors, ministry leaders, and church planters.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In 2018 a team was able to take an exploration trip that helped with church expansion and we will be sending two teams in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>REACH Nicaragua – Feed My Lambs</strong><br>Feed My Lambs seeks to meet the physical and spiritual needs of children in Nicaragua. They believe that the only way to break the cycle of poverty and bring change to the sense of hopelessness that exists amongst the poor is to start with the children and bring them into a relationship with Jesus—the one true hope for the world. The Point partners with Feed My Lambs to support children’s outreach and feeding programs. In 2018 a team was able to take an exploration trip and support children’s feeding and outreach. Our students at The Point will be focused on reaching this country and we will be sending a team of student in 2019.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>REACH Philippines – Aeta Bible Study Center</strong><br>ABSC is focused on reaching the Aeta people who are the outcast of Filipino society. Most Aeta’s are denied education and medical care. The ministry’s vision is to teach the future generations of the Aeta people through the power of the practical gospel. The Point partners with ABSC to support pastors and plant churches in remote Aeta Villages. In 2018 we completed one church building and paid for feedings. In 2019 our teams will complete two more church buildings.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>REACH Togo – African Kids Evangelism Ministries&nbsp;</strong><br>AKEM is focused on reaching the next generation of Togolese children with the transforming power of the gospel. The founding church is located outside of the capital city, Lome, and has established a school with over 1,000 children. They are also reaching out in northern Togo through church planting. The Point partners with AKEM through medical clinics and support for church planting. In 2018 an exploratory medical team visited Togo and in 2019 we will send a full medical team.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As we continue to pursue our vision of reaching 50 nations in our first 50 years as a church, we have chosen to partner with two US-based mission organizations: Advancing Native Missions and World Help. These amazing organizations help us in building all our international partnerships and in planning all of our trips.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To see upcoming trip dates and information, or to apply for a trip, visit:&nbsp;<a href="http://thepointva.com/reachcountries">thepointva.com/reachcountries</a></p>

      <title>Presence Over Presents</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2018/12/19/presence-over-presents</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Today’s blog is written by Hannah Critzer. Read as she shares how we only find true satisfaction in God.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“His soul shall be satisfied on Mount Ephraim and Gilead.”<br>-Jeremiah 50:19&nbsp;</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Our Spiritual appetite can only be satisfied with Jesus.” -Nicky Gumbel.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Would I be satisfied if I were to lose our Christmas holiday decorations, our lights, our presents, our food, even our Christmas parties if I were to just have Jesus? The scripture reference is from Jeremiah in which Jeremiah is trying to teach the readers the promises of God. One of the promises Jeremiah mentions is God wants the readers to be satisfied by the Lord alone. If we were to simply remember Jesus being born and the sacrifice it took our Heavenly Father to give Jesus to the world, would we still be satisfied? Satisfaction, or contentment at the core means being fulfilled. Nothing else needs to be added or given to be satisfied.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My husband and I have been married for a little over 3 years and at the beginning of our marriage I had this goal or drive to make every holiday, especially Christmas, be as festive as it could possibly be. We went to our local dollar store our first Christmas (newly married budgeters) and bought as much Christmas decorations and lights we could fit in our basket. We loved putting them up and decorating our first home together. That being said, I am for Christmas decorations and festivities but let me explain. I have found that the lights, the music, the decorations, even the food of Christmas time does not truly and deeply satisfy my soul. I am always looking for new decorations, and lights for our ever increasing Christmas holiday décor, or searching for the perfect gift that will get old within the year. Does it give me joy? Yes. Does it make me smile and want to bring my friends and family together for Christmas parties galore? Yes, and it still does. I am in no way, shape or form saying I am boycotting Christmas festivities and becoming the Grinch! This is more of a mindset than an actual tangible action. Christmas is a reminder to give my gaze and heart once again back unto the Father and let Him satisfy me apart from any materialistic item or experience. The simplest way I can think of doing that is reading His word and letting scripture melt onto our hearts so that we are reminded once again how much He loves us and wants us to be satisfied in Him.&nbsp;<em>“Look with wonder at the depth of the Father’s marvelous love that He has lavished on us!” (1 John 3:1b)</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The closer one comes to God; the more joy is experienced. Joy based not on circumstances or passing emotion but the joy of the Lord that comes from knowing Him”. -C.S. Lewis</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Father, thank you for all the joys and beautiful festivities that Christmas brings. But more importantly than all the lights and sounds of the season, help me turn my heart and attention to Your heart right now and not get caught up in the commercialized hype. Help my true satisfaction be found in You and Your presence. Thank You, Father for sending your Son to us to be truly satisfied from the inside out.</p>

      <title>Light of the World</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2018/12/25/light-of-the-world</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Today’s blog is written by Chris Eagle. Read as he shares how his family christmas traditions help him focus on the true meaning of Christmas.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christmas traditions are something I think we all secretly wait for every year. For many of us, we seem to have some we remember from our childhood, and now maybe even cling to as adults. When I look back to my childhood and Christmas, now as an adult, I truly love the tradition of putting up the Christmas tree. For us, a real pine tree is not an option, our cats like to eat it! The picturesque pulling out of that fake Dillard from the box we store it in, is a thing of beauty! Of course, we always add some type of lights, only to find that one lightbulb that doesn’t work! Probably one of my favorite things is putting up our ornaments. They are from the places we’ve traveled, the things we enjoy, older ones I made as a child, to the ones we received from other family members. I love to think about what the ornament means and how it impacts me and my thoughts and my journey to that very moment in time putting it on the tree.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Amidst the Christmas music, boxes thrown everywhere, fake pine needles and fighting off the animals as they try and help decorate the tree, it is finally time to plug in the lights.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Boom! The lights come on! Woo! This spectacular moment signifies that the tree if finally finished, and it is the beginning of the Christmas season! Finally, I can stop being poked by fake pine branches. Now, the lights don’t just light up the tree, they also light up the room, the window it sits in front of, the yard out front, and can even be seen as folks drive down the road. For most, the lighting of the tree marks the beginning of the Christmas season. For me, the lighting of the Christmas tree represents the virgin birth of Jesus and the arrival of our Savior in the flesh.&nbsp;<em>Matthew 1:23 &amp; 25, “23 Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel (which means, God with us). 25 but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.”</em>Jesus brought a beaming light into our world, that bright light still shines today, much like the Christmas tree that shines bright all over our living room and out the window. John 8:12 says,&nbsp;<em>“Again, Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk into darkness but will have the light of life.”</em>&nbsp;I hope we continue to light up all of our trees as a reminder of the light Jesus brought into this world.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As we gather around our beautifully decorated, beaming Christmas tree on Christmas morning, my hope and prayer for everyone is that we remember the birth of our great King many years ago and the light He brings to change the world for eternity!</p>

      <title>Rejoice</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Today’s blog is written by Brandi Kirby. Read as she shares with us how she chooses to rejoice in the hope Jesus brings even in seasons of darkness.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“When they saw the star, they were filled with joy!”<br>-Matthew 2:10</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I was a little girl my parents allowed me to have a tiny tree in my bedroom. Picture a plump version of a Charlie Brown tree with bright white and multi-colored lights. The dazzling lights against the tinsel mesmerized me for weeks! The joy of the upcoming day was almost too much to contain. I felt like I was going to burst. I would belt out the verses of Jingle Bells and Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer along with the classic hymns of Silent Night and O Come All Ye Faithful as I caroled with my friends.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A lot has changed since then; my tree is much bigger, my life more complex, but the twinkle of the holiday lights and the sound of the music still sparks excitement in my heart. As Christians, we know Christmas is much more than holiday lights, tinsel, good music and shopping for the perfect gift. Christmas is a specific time to celebrate and rejoice because of the birth of our Savior and King, Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the book of Matthew, three wise men visit Jerusalem asking where they could find the new born king. They&nbsp;<em>“saw his star as it rose.” (Matthew 2:2)</em>&nbsp;Take a minute to think about his star. It had to twinkle and shine bright high in the sky. It guided their way to baby Jesus. I imagine they couldn’t contain their excitement seeing that light! A light in the sky shown bright for the light of the world to be born in darkness.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Darkness is something we all experience in our life on this Earth. This year, my family faced several life-threatening illnesses. My city and nation were scarred by hate and violence. Many families are without their loved ones this Christmas. I am reminded in all of this the Lord commands us to be joyful. The word rejoice is a verb, therefore it is something you do. We all know it is difficult to rejoice in pain, but Paul tells us in 2 Corinthians 6:10,&nbsp;<em>“sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything.”</em>&nbsp;He goes on to say in Philippians 4:4,&nbsp;<em>“Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!”</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus was born, rejoice! Jesus was born; rejoice in sadness. Jesus was born; rejoice in pain and hurt.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Father God – Thank you for the light of the world. May the light in our hearts never grow dim. I pray we faithfully choose each day to be joyful and rejoice in you always.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“I have come as a light to shine in this dark world, so that all who put their trust in me will no longer remain in the dark.”<br>-John 12:46</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Exult in his holy name; rejoice, you who worship the Lord.”<br>-1 Chronicles 16:10</em></p>

      <title>A Desire for More</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Today’s blog is written by Brandi Kirby, who just came back from a REACH mission trip. She shares her experience in the Philippines with her fellow teammates and how God is working and doing amazing things there!</em>&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">At 38, I thought to myself, there has to be more to my walk with the Lord than leading a small group and serving at church on Sundays. I had a deep stirring in my heart to want more of Jesus, to know Him deeper and to serve Him greater. So, I took a step in faith and headed to the Philippines to serve with my church.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God showed me more on this trip. I gained brothers and sisters in Christ.&nbsp;I saw God’s greatness through instantly answered prayers. I learned to love deeper than I ever knew I could.&nbsp;I experienced love with no boundaries and I learned our ministry shouldn’t either. This mission trip changed my life.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We helped construct a church in a village that was a day’s walk from the main road – so thankful for our vehicle! There were so many children and adults and not many spoke English. We laughed, played and worked alongside them. One night, during our two nights stay, we shared the Jesus Film Project in their native language. I witnessed the power of praying in the name of the Lord in faith, and my request was answered instantly. There were wild dogs in the village that hadn’t bark during the video until the most important part. We paused the video where Jesus was lifted on the cross so the village pastor began to give a message, but we couldn’t hear because of the dogs. They barked like crazy as if they had a purpose, so I prayed fiercely. The dogs were silenced! I was later asked by one of my team members if I noticed what happened with the dogs because he was praying too! A few villagers were saved that evening.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A few days later, we took the film to another village. I witnessed many being saved that night. The movie was paused at the same moment, their pastor preached a powerful message – I heard and felt passion in his tone – then I experienced the most exhilarating feeling. I heard them repeating in unison a prayer in their language. I knew with every fiber of my heart what had just happened. We were told that MANY had accepted Christ into their hearts that night!</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Throughout the week, we participated in worship that caused my heart to swell from the sweet children’s voices praising the Lord. We had devotional time and shared our testimonies of faith with children who were like sponges wanting to hear hope and gain wisdom. We connected despite the language barrier through love. Our team grew together through our serving, encouraging and sharing with each other. The last day of our trip a sister &amp; fellow teammate conquered her own internal battle. She shared her testimony for the very first time with the children of the school. She is no longer a slave to that fear which prevented her from declaring God’s victory in her life. We serve an awesome God!</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Do you feel God stirring up your heart for more like Brandi?

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Today’s blog is written by Debbie Fletcher. Debbie and her husband Lee Fletcher are dedicated volunteers who serve in many areas and lead a group called “Starting Point”.&nbsp;</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” (-Jeremiah 29:11)</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">No matter how God has prepared us in advance for when we surrender our lives to serve Him, we are not done or fully grown. In fact, the greatest challenges to learn and grow are ahead! Not coincidentally, Paul met Christ for the first time on a road and he would “meet” Him on every road he traveled for the rest of his life.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We probably did not see a light and hear a voice from Heaven, but we met Christ somewhere on the road to our chosen destinations. Our lives took a detour at that point, and we’ve been walking ever since on the roads He’s placed before us. Life is not only about receiving Jesus and one day seeing Him. Life also is about walking with Christ and learning from Him on the winding road of this life on earth.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lee and I are excited to be leading a group through a course called “Starting Point”, beginning on February 26th. It is designed for new believers, those with questions about their faith walk, or perhaps someone who has been away from the church and is coming back. This life God has given us is quite a journey, it only takes one step to accept God as your Savior. We would LOVE to walk along side you as we share this study of Starting Point. You can find us at: thepointva.com/groups – Starting Point.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Just like our human relationships, we can only know each other, begin to trust each other, and love each other with time spent together. Are we spending purposeful time with our Heavenly Father? His greatest desire is to have us, all of us. This can seem daunting at times, can’t it? Let God show you an area you might need to adjust, in order to be at His feet more often.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Father, you have so much to give, share, and teach us through this life on earth. I pray our eyes and heart would always be open to your sweet voice whispering in our ear. There is no better place to be than aligned with your will, walking in your footsteps. Equip us mightily Lord, with power and discernment we can only get from you. We love you Lord Jesus!! Amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>In teaching the women at our Chosen Conference about who we are in Christ, I was miserable with the thought that I had a list to share – a dry, factual list. My heart’s desire was for us to meet with God over His life giving scripture, not pass the time until lunch. I needed our Heavenly Father to breathe on these truths, and my message was falling so short. Then, I thought of the words my dad wrote in a book he had given to me when I was 19. For the 1st time in over a decade I opened that book to stir my emotions and remember what it’s like to read that my dad saw me in a special light. When I cracked open that dusty spine out fell the following devotional. I don’t recall when I wrote it or why, but I do know it presented the perfect approach to God’s Word for us. What follows is how the Spirit opened the door to our receiving His Word and our identity in Christ at the Chosen Conference.</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A plain book sits guarded on my bookshelf between my first Bible and a journal I started in the fifth grade. It is one of my most treasured possessions. Not for the romantic story that strummed my 19 year old heart once upon a time, but for the inscription my dad wrote to me on the title page. I can almost see how his hand must have looked as it rested on the textured paper; how it would have slightly jolted like an EKG as he penned the tall letters. I can imagine him pausing to conjure up just the right adjectives to express his heart for me. I wonder how he would have edited or elaborated his tender words if he had known that this love note would someday be a precious treasure to me, a blessing from a father to his eldest daughter. If Dad were living today, I think he would let out a big “Ha!” knowing that the hum of his expression still dances through my soul and is making its way into my faith community.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In my mind, this is evidence that our Heavenly Father’s hand never rests and is still inscribing His love even through a shelved dedication. His hand penned a father’s love letter on my dad’s heart, which filtered down to me. Wow, what a sweet God He is. What an unexpected duet between the past and our unlimited God!<br>I love that the Lord always has something from His heart to share with us, and it amazes me that His voice sounds the same so often regardless of the instrument He chooses to play. The lyrics may change but the melody is always the same. Just like my dad’s note, our Heavenly Father’s voice always resonates with profound love, giving life and blessing through words.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To think that our God, our Abba-Father, who waited for us to be born to this specific generation humbled Himself to the point of writing the purest love note ever written and with the precious blood of His Son, our Redeemer. He has chosen us all to receive this blessing! Precise words picked with purpose, written with emotion and transparency to you, His child. Based on the treasure hidden on my bookshelf, I know that the expression of a father’s devotion will stay with a woman throughout her life, but the expression of God’s devotion to that woman will change her life. Be blessed! Your Heavenly Father has composed an inscription just for you on more than a title page.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“…you are precious to me. You are honored, and I love you.” (Isaiah 43:4 NLT)</em></p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>This week’s blog is written by Liz Stapleton, who volunteers in the KidsPoint team as the Special Needs Coordinator.</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; March 3rd, 2010, a day my life would be forever changed. My daughter, Lily, was born and she was diagnosed with Down syndrome. I wasn’t sure at the time what the future would hold, but with God by our side, a few surgeries, specialists, hospital stays and a medical diagnosis it has been an incredible journey. Fast forward to 2014, we moved from North Carolina to Charlottesville and a couple of years later Lily was also diagnosed with Autism. This was hard for me to process at the time, but we have worked through and continue to work through the challenges she faces every day.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We had been looking for a church and visited a few, but they were not a fit for our family, especially Lily. This was a challenging time; because as a Christian I wanted a church community, but as special needs parent I also needed to know that Lily would be ok. We visited The Point one Sunday and Lily hit another child. I really enjoyed the service, but at the same time didn’t know if it could be a place for Lily. How could I explain sensory related issues, Down syndrome, and Autism? The next day a lady from Kids Point reached out. She said, “We want The Point to be a place for your whole family and want to provide a one-on-one Buddy for Lily.” I knew at that time The Point was a place we could call home.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Point has been such an amazing witness in our lives of Christ’s love for everyone and I really wanted to serve, but struggled with what God was calling me to do. As a special needs parent, routine and structure is important. How could I serve and keep Lily’s routine the same? I was invited to attend a special needs interest meeting at The Point and in that meeting I realized this is it – this is what God is calling me to do. I knew in that moment that God wanted me to help other special needs families feel welcome at The Point, the same way that God provided for our family.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am so excited to be a part of the special needs Buddy program and to be able to provide one-on-one care for individuals with special needs. This is a ministry that helps families just like ours call The Point home and is a welcoming environment for all individuals of different abilities. The buddy program includes a one-on-one Buddy, a sensory break space, and working with special needs families to show the love of Christ.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>If you are interested in being a part of this ministry, please contact Liz Stapleton at 828-260-7815 or lizstapleton1@gmail.com.</em></p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>2 Samuel 5:4-10 (NIV)</em></strong><em><br>4 David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years.<br>5 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.<br>6 The king and his men marched to Jerusalem to attack the Jebusites, who lived there. The Jebusites said to David, “You will not get in here; even the blind and the lame can ward you off.” They thought, “David cannot get in here.”<br>7 Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion—which is the City of David.<br>8 On that day David had said, “Anyone who conquers the Jebusites will have to use the water shaft to reach those ‘lame and blind’ who are David’s enemies.” That is why they say, “The ‘blind and lame’ will not enter the palace.”<br>9 David then took up residence in the fortress and called it the City of David. He built up the area around it, from the terraces inward.<br>10 And he became more and more powerful, because the Lord God Almighty was with him.</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">At some point in each of our lives we experience a leading from God but we’re not quite sure how it will come about. Abram was told by God that he would father a great nation, but he couldn’t even father a son. Gideon was told by God that he would save Israel from the Midianites, but all that Gideon could see was his personal inadequacy. When David was led by God to take the Jebusite city that would later bear his name – the City of David – it seemed like an impossible task. When God leads He always makes a way.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On my recent trip to Israel I experienced the Bible coming to life in new and fresh ways as I both read about and saw first-hand the very places where events from Scripture unfolded. I stood atop Mt. Carmel where Elijah defeated the prophets of Baal. I looked with amazement over the Valley of Megiddo where the Battle of Armageddon will one day occur. I walked the streets of Jerusalem where Jesus once walked; where He healed the sick, carried His cross, and where He would have been crucified and buried.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The moment that struck me the greatest was when I walked through an ancient cave system under the City of David, the original Jebusite city that David conquered with the leadership of Joab.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>1 Chronicles 11:6 (NIV)</strong><br><em>David had said, “Whoever leads the attack on the Jebusites will become commander-in-chief.” Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, and so he received the command.</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">While walking through the cave system, our guide pointed to a deep shaft, and she made the connection: “This is most likely the water shaft that Joab would have scaled to get inside the city walls and to open the gate of the city for his army.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As I reflected on that water shaft I was reminded that when God leads us to something, when He puts a vision, a burden, or desire on our hearts, He has already made a way.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I would love for you to experience Israel first-hand as I experienced it, and to see the Bible come alive in a way that you’ve never known before. I’m excited to announce that next February I will be leading a trip to Israel.

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Today’s blog is written by Lili Galvez. Lili is a high school junior who loves serving through worship in our StudentLife and KidsPoint environments.</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;As a student I love learning more about Jesus, engaging in worship, participating in games, and spending quality time with friends. Episode was an amazing youth retreat that allowed opportunities for students to grow in fellowship together.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our ride to North Carolina was such a blast because most of the time we cranked up the radio and sang along to just about any song. I also loved this part of the trip because I got a chance to reconnect with friends who have moved away.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our first session opened up with a few games to earn points for our team. Many students from our church participated and made an impact in this year’s competition. After the games, we moved on to worship. The band this year was great, and they included many songs we sing at First Wednesday, like Every Beat! Besides the sessions and worship, there was a variety of fun activities to do while we stayed there; such as arts and crafts. On the second day of camp, we were given free time for a few hours. A group of us decided to play a game of volleyball. When we first started playing, I felt extremely insecure. However, throughout the game, my attitude changed knowing my friends and leaders were playing right by my side and were cheering me on. Episode has that much of an effect on us by bringing small groups closer.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One night, my small group began opening up about some of the challenges they had been struggling with that I had never known. In a way, we all have similar stories and that is when I knew it was a night of breakthrough. The theme of Episode was to be Set Apart. A quote that helped me put this in perspective was, “God wants to set you apart because He wants to elevate you above a common life.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is easy to give into the societal pressures of this world, but we must accept that we are called to be different from everyone else. There are times I feel left out by others, but then I am reminded that I have a home group and leaders who teach us to embrace our identity in Christ. I cannot even begin to express how important community is. Church retreats like Episode, build character, trust, relationships, and confidence in the Lord. Whether you are a grandparent, a parent, or a student, I highly suggest visiting StudentLife and joining us for future trips.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Today’s blog is written by Liz Guyer, one of our Student Life leaders. We are so thankful for her heart in wanting to see our next generation&nbsp;grow deeper in&nbsp;their faith.&nbsp;</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ve been a youth leader for two years now and when I was asked to write a blog post on our experience at Episode I was so jazzed to share my experience with our church family. But the truth is, the best way for me to share all that went down in that incredible weekend is to write an open letter to our students. A letter from me personally sharing my heart of gratitude and all that they mean to me. I’d like to invite you into our ministry for just a minute, to get a glimpse of what it’s like to work with youth.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear Students,</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This weekend at Episode there were 27 of you, 8 of us (leaders). We’re certainly outnumbered but that doesn’t even matter because you carry yourselves in a way that needs little to no guidance from us leaders. Time and again you make me proud to wear a nametag that says “The Point” because you exemplify Jesus to the other students here, you take notes and listen diligently during the sessions, and you respect other leaders from different churches. You are the kind of students I love to claim as my own, whether you are on stage racking up points for the Yellow team in crazy games or running up to the stage to sing worship songs. This weekend was my third time to Episode and each group we take brings me a different experience.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My first year I wasn’t even a youth leader, just an extra warm body to keep you crazies in line. Last year I was on a knee scooter with a broken foot and leading six girls on my own. This year I had both of my feet (Praise the Lord) and a co-leader in Ashton. But what I really want to say to you is this: You keep me coming back for more sleep deprived, ridiculous nights eating mostly cereal at meals and you draw me closer to God. When you ask questions that are off script, ones that are on your heart rather than the open ended ones on my guide, you get me to stretch myself to learn more about Him as I research and dig and look over scripture to help you find the answers you’re looking for. Thank you for that.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I see you get excited about taking your faith life into your own hands, you remind me that we serve a God who is exciting and then I got motivated to dive into my relationship with Him all over again. Thank you for that. When you look to me for advice or guidance, when you genuinely want to sit next to me during sessions or get up on chairs and dance with me in the lecture hall, or play a crazy loud game of big booty (it’s not what it sounds like) for everyone to see and hear you affirm that this is in fact my calling and greatest joy. Thank you for that.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I hope you know how fiercely this event was prayed over. How many hours were logged in preparation for you. And I don’t say that for the recognition or affirmation but because I want you to know how loved you are. Not just by me. But the seven others that put their lives on hold to spend a weekend with you. There is nothing greater I can do with my time than pour into y’all. It is a gift and a calling to be a part of your lives and to experience your walk in faith.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For the boys in my van on the way home, thank you for showering that morning. And for playing my silly card question game. And for singing backstreet boys and Taylor Swift. I’m sorry I got hangry, but thank you for humbling me quickly and reminding me to be selfless. That you guys are my highest priority. Thank you to all our students for loving me as one of your leaders. And all the praise hands to God for quietly pushing me to step in obedience to work with youth, for letting me be along for the ride. This privilege is not one I take lightly. I have loved every late night devo session, early morning wake up calls, running in the rain to get to the dining hall, getting you into picture formation and telling you to close your eyes because the sun is “SO BRIGHT” until we were ready for our photo op.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I love being your leader and I love getting to watch you grow through our time at Episode. I hope I have several more years to enjoy these retreats with you but if there’s one thing I’ve learned it’s to be present and enjoy the moments you do have. So I’m holding onto the memories of this one fiercely and reliving every laughable overwhelming and insane moment. Special shout out to team yellow for coming in clutch in that final relay game and for bringing home the battle of the (taco) bell. You guys are seriously the best.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Bless up,</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Elizabeth Guyer</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>If you would like to get involved with our StudentLife ministry email caleb@thepointva.com for more information on how you can serve!&nbsp;</em></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have you ever run out of anything? Energy? Time? Money? Even though we may try to convince ourselves otherwise, we have a diminishing supply of everything. Without sleep, we will not have energy. Without gas, our vehicle will not run. Without food, we will waste away. Without money, we cannot pay our bills.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">While we are dependent beings, God is self-existent – He never runs out. He has an infinite supply. In his book&nbsp;<em>The Power of God’s Names</em>&nbsp;Tony Evans says, “God is the only truly independent being in the universe because He is the only being who is self-generating.” Think about that. God is completely self-sufficient. He is not dependent on anyone or anything. He never changes. He never runs out of energy.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Hebrew name for God, Jehovah, is the self-revealing name of God. The name Jehovah speaks to God’s person, His character, and His desire to relate to His creation personally. The same God who existed before time began wants to know us personally.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God’s name Jehovah shows us that God desires relationship with us. When we are in relationship with God we connect into His supply. Since God has everything, He can provide for every need. And He is never without.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Recently I was reading in the Psalms, and a few verses stood out to me, “From men with Your hand, O LORD, from men of the world, whose portion is in this life, and whose belly You fill with Your treasure. They are satisfied with children and leave their abundance to their babes. As for me, I shall behold Your face in righteousness; I will be satisfied with Your likeness when I awake.”&nbsp;<em>(-Psalm 17:14-15 NASB)</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we see LORD in all capitals, this is an indication the word is translated for the Hebrew for Jehovah. In these verses, we see Jehovah compared to the “portion in this life.” We either look for this world to fill us or we look to God to fill us. The thing about when we look for our reward in this life is that it will always fall short. It may give us a short-term sense of satisfaction but in the long run everything we gain will be lost. It will be used up or absorbed by someone else. True satisfaction is only found in Jehovah. Why? Because Jehovah is self-existent. Out of His abundance, He provides for us. Out of His character, He molds and shapes us. Out of His endless strength, He upholds us.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we turn to this world for solutions and satisfaction we will always be looking for more. The supply will always run out. We will always need more. But when we turn to Jehovah, we are fully supplied and lack nothing. This does not mean we have everything we want, or even everything we think we need. It means we are supplied with the internal and the eternal. It means we have access to the character, power, and strength of God. It means we have everything God knows we need. It means that our greatest need, the need for relationship with Him is fulfilled.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Think about your life. What are you depending on to meet your needs? Are you looking for your “portion” in the things and people around you? Or are you looking to Jehovah, the only one who can truly satisfy?</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br>“Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!”&nbsp;<em>(-Matthew 7:7-11)</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A few years ago, when both of our children were in college, we wanted to provide cars for them both. Since their campuses were at opposite ends of the state, the logistics of getting them to and from school was a real challenge. At the same time, our church had started a building campaign for an expansion project and was asking for a three-year pledge from all of the members. The church was bursting at the seams and we wanted to be faithful and help with that need. In our prayers, we sensed God continually challenging us to increase the amount we thought we could give and ended up pledging the amount we had saved for the cars. During this same season, we had been praying for a beloved older couple, relatives who were well-off financially and we thought would be blessed if they could experience the joy of giving generously.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In faith, we pledged the savings originally intended for the cars, praying that God would bless the church and that it would be a testimony of trust and faithfulness for our children. Just as Tony Evans says in his book The Power of God’s Names, whatever it is that you’re holding on to so tightly – whether it’s your career, family, marriage, health finances, search for a mate – you have to let that go in order to experience Jehovah Jireh.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Shortly after we made our pledge, out of the blue, we received a check in the mail from this older couple, for the exact same amount as our pledge, with a note saying they wanted to help with the purchase of the cars. As glad as we were to have the funds, we were even happier to see their joy in giving. What an incredible answer to our prayers and an opportunity to demonstrate to our children how God provided through trusting in Him!</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Has there been a time when you felt you didn’t want to ask for too much from God? Are your prayers too small, thinking you don’t deserve more? Why or why not?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Lord, thank you that you are bigger than all of my needs. That you delight in providing more than what I could ever ask. May I never be too afraid to ask for the good things that you have waiting to give to your children. May my prayers reflect this belief and trust that as Jehovah Jireh, you are my great Provider for all that I need and all that is good for me. Thank you Lord. Amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Today’s blog is written by Rich Newsome who reminds us that we can only find perfect and complete peace in Jehovah Shalom.</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br>“But the Lord said to him, “Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die.” So Gideon built an altar to the Lord there and called it The LORD Is Peace.”&nbsp;<em>(-Judges 6:23-24a)</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What do you think of when you hear the word “peace”? Maybe a state of inner calm or the lack of conflict or turmoil? Peace is something we strive for, but it seems unattainable. We may have glimpses of it, but our peace doesn’t last very long.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Take a second look at today’s scripture verse. Notice that Gideon names the altar “The LORD is Peace”. He doesn’t say the LORD of peace or the LORD gives peace. He says that God Himself is peace. The Hebrew word for peace is shalom. This is a familiar word to many of us, but what does it really mean? It means wellbeing, integrity, security, and calmness. In Israel, shalom is a common way to greet a person or say farewell to someone. With this greeting, you are expressing your desire that they would be healthy, prosperous, and fulfilled and that they would be in harmony with themselves, others, and God.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Wouldn’t it be great if we could impart shalom upon each other by simply saying the word? When I’m totally distraught and I’m desperate for peace, a kind and encouraging word goes a long way, but it doesn’t heal my deepest need. My deepest need for peace comes from the Prince of Peace, Jesus Christ. Jesus is our Jehovah-Shalom. In Ephesians 2:14, Paul says of Jesus, “He is our peace”. Jesus is the source of all peace. We were separated from God because of our sins, but Jesus reconciled us, making peace through His blood.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One of my favorite verses in the Bible is from John 16:33 where Jesus said, “I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”<br>In John 14:27, Jesus said, “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Only Jesus can give us the peace (shalom) that we desire in our hearts. He offers us peace in the present and peace in eternity. What an amazing gift!</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Many of us rely on distractions to bring us some temporary peace and there are certainly plenty of opportunities for distraction in our world today. The world offers empty promises, but Jesus, our Prince of Peace, offers perfect and lasting peace. Where are you placing your hope for peace today and for eternity?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Jehovah Shalom, You are holy and perfect, full of grace and truth. I confess that I’m prone to look elsewhere for comfort and peace. Forgive me for sometimes placing my trust in the world instead of You. I want more of Your peace which means I want more of You. Fill me with your presence, lead me beside the still waters, restore my soul, and lead me in the paths of righteousness for Your Name’s sake. In Jesus’ Name I pray, Amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Today’s blog is written by Delaney Foster who was baptized this past Sunday. She shares her story about how she developed a relationship with God and what it means for her to get baptized.&nbsp;</em><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Growing up in a Methodist family, I have always been surrounded by the love and comfort of our amazing God. I grew up in a small church that half of my town attended. My whole family fostered my relationship with Jesus and throughout my life I felt totally full of the love of God. Throughout my trials and tribulations in the short time I’ve been on this Earth, I have known to lean on God in prayer and worship, and as promised it has all been for a greater good.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My first real experience with this was in the 6th grade. My older sister, Ainsley, left for college as I entered middle school. She came back a few short months later, very sick and with no diagnosis. After days of appointments and an emergency trip to the hospital, I experienced my first (from what I remember) moments of doubt. “How could this be happening to my sister?” She is one of the best people I know; she gave constant love, support, and encouragement and never asked anything in return. “Why us, God?” I remember the night that the doctor told my mom that her kidneys were beginning to fail, which could lead to death. I didn’t know what was going on at the time, but I knew it was bad because of my mother’s reaction. I slept at my dad’s house that night and when I went into the bathroom to get ready for bed, I completely gave it up to God. I remember sitting on the floor, crying, praying like I had never prayed before to heal my sister. The lyrics “I’ll stand, with arms high and heart abandoned,” come to mind when I remember this night. I prayed like it was the absolute last thing I would do. This was the day I truly learned to lean on God, to give it all to him in times of fear, heartache, and doubt, to place it at the foot of the cross and rest easy knowing that my God is the most powerful, incredible healer. Within days, my sister’s health began to improve. I knew this was due to God’s grace, his guidance of every person who helped my sister, and his unfailing love.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fast forward six years, and I’m entering my first year of college. After years of continued spiritual growth, support from family, and an incredible church family, I felt beyond prepared for this transition. I had no idea how hard it would truly be. Between the pressure of school, being away from my support system, and the many social pressures that accompany college, it is safe to say I strayed from God a few times. I sought comfort from other people, I longed to conform to the “normal” college life, I felt lost with no church here to call home. But, as always, my God never left me. I received a random text from a family friend, now living in Charlottesville, to “try this new church” with her. I thought “what do I have to lose?” and jumped out of bed, quickly got ready, and was on my way to The Point. I will never forget this service. I sat down and listened to the story of a man who sacrificed his life in the name of God. I was totally enveloped by God’s word in this moment, I still have the notecard reading, “The cross before me, the world behind me” hanging above my desk. I felt changed after that service; I couldn’t stop talking about it. Not long after, I brought my roommate and four or five close friends to church with me. I had never felt hooked to the word like I did after that sermon, and it continues to stick with me now. I know that God brought me and my friends to this church to renew our faith, and provide me with the support I desperately needed to get through the pressures of school. Every person I met at The Point quickly became family, especially Lannie and Suzanne White, who after finding out I was spending $30 on Uber rides to and from church every Sunday, went out of their way to pick me up for church each week for the remainder of the semester. I felt loved; the kind of loved that can only be found in our amazing God.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From that first Sunday, I felt called to baptism. I had been christened as an infant, but I felt called to proclaim this spiritual rebirth. With encouragement from close friends and family, and my “Church parents” Lannie and Suz, I reached out to the the amazing people in my new found church home, and was quickly on my way to baptism. To me, this represents a personal declaration of faith and commitment to my God. I sometimes felt unworthy of this kind of commitment, until I realized that God already loved me so, so much, and I am worthy of his love. I am ready to commit, for myself, my life to the service of God, to rest on his grace, to love unconditionally, to forgive with open arms, to serve in his name, to know I am loved without fear of abandonment. Although I have been on this amazing journey for all of my life, I can’t wait to proclaim this love and commitment to God. His love, forgiveness, and grace is the most rewarding gift I have ever received, and I feel so full of them that I want to pour it out onto others and show them how great it is to be a beloved child of God.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Today’s blog is written by Bonnie Russman who reminds us that we don’t fight our battles alone but that the LORD is our banner.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim. Moses said to Joshua,“Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hands.” So Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had ordered, and Moses, Aaron and Hurwent to the top of the hill. As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning. When Moses’ hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up—one on one side, one on the other—so that his hands remained steady till sunset. So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army with the sword. Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write this on a scroll as something to be remembered and make sure that Joshua hears it, because I will completely blot out the name of Amalek from under heaven.” Moses built an altar and called it The LORD is my Banner. He said, “Because hands were lifted up against the throne of the LORD, the LORD will be at war against the Amalekites from generation to generation.”</em>&nbsp;(–Exodus 17:8-16)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Whether it is a hand-made sign carried by a group of protestors in Washington, D.C., the colorful pennant of a local baseball team, or the flag of a nation being held high as its soldiers march into battle, banners have historically been used to make a statement. They are proclamations and expressions of allegiance, pride, support, or love. They are often displayed as a visible symbol of something much deeper – a truly heartfelt belief.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In this passage from Exodus, the people of Israel won a great victory under the Lord’s direction and favor, and through Moses’ obedience and leadership the enemy was defeated. As Moses’ hands were lifted up in praise, God Himself was their banner!</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We, too, have our battles, like the athletes, demonstrators, or soldiers. Life brings us trials and challenges, but we also have a very real spiritual enemy who wants to see us defeated. What about our banner? What do we hold up in this life-long battle? What is our symbol of allegiance, pride, and proclamation? In what do we deeply believe?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am reminded of a great old hymn of the church, “Onward Christian soldiers, marching as to war, with the cross of Jesus going on before!” Indeed, Christ Himself is our banner, and His cross is the terrible, beautiful, and everlasting symbol of our victory! It is His profound expression of love for us, and beneath it we find our hope and rest.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“You have given a banner to those who fear You, that it may be displayed because of the truth.”</em>&nbsp;(-Psalm 60:4)&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>If you were to make an actual banner that expressed or proclaimed your faith in Jesus and what He means to you, what would it look like? Think of its color, size, shape, and what symbols or words you would use to display your love for Him. As you envision this banner, thank God for who He is and all that He has done for you.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Thank You, oh God, for giving us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Help me to remember that you are always with me, sending your Holy Spirit to guide, protect, and defend. Give me courage each day to stand strong and fight with the mighty spiritual weapons that You provide, and may I always lift high the cross with passion, pride, and love. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Today’s blog is written by Trevor Gach. Read as he challenges us to look at circumstances in which Jehovah Mekoddishkem, The LORD Who Sanctifies, stretches us.</em><br><br><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br>“So set yourselves apart to be holy, for I am the Lord your God. Keep all my decrees by putting them into practice, for I am the Lord who makes you holy.”<em>(Leviticus 20:7-8 NLT)</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Now may the God of peace make you holy in every way, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless until our Lord Jesus Christ comes again. God will make this happen, for he who calls you is faithful.”&nbsp;<em>(1 Thessalonians 5:23-24 NLT)</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sanctified (to be set apart, pure, and holy) is quite the commandment to live up to. In Leviticus, we learn that it is the Lord who sanctifies us. It is not by our own power, or by anything we can humanly do. It is God working in us and through us. To be sanctified means to be unique and separate.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So how do we become separate from this world? How are we to become sanctified? C.S. Lewis said in his book Mere Christianity, “God is forcing us on, up, or to a higher level: putting us in situations where we will have to be very much braver, or more patient, or more loving, than we ever dreamed of being before. It seems to us all unnecessary: but that is because we have not yet the slightest notion of the tremendous thing he means to make of us.” God is doing a work in our lives. He is moving in and taking over – if we let Him! Sanctification is not something that happens in an instant or something that we can force on ourselves. It is the work of God and Him alone. As Leviticus says, we must keep his decrees and put them into practice, then let God start the process of making us holy. Sanctification and salvation are two different things. Although salvation may place us on the right path to heaven, the process of sanctification brings us closer to God while we are on this earth, and prepares us for an eternity with Him.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Think about your current circumstances: Are there situations in your life where you feel God is stretching you to dig deeper, press in harder, or step out in faith like never before? This is God’s sanctification process at work in you.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>God, I am incredibly thankful for the work you have started in my life. I pray that you would continue the process of making me set apart from this world. Help me to be who you say I am, and not who this world says I am. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Today’s blog is written by Mary Anna Wu. Read as she reminds us of the restorative nature of God and how His healing is available to us!</em><br></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There the LORD made a decree and a law for [the Israelites] and there he tested them. He said, “If you listen carefully to the voice of the LORD your God and do what is right in his eyes, if you pay attention to his commands and keep all his decrees, I will not bring on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I am the LORD, who heals you.”&nbsp;<em>(Exodus 15:25b-26 NIV)</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Lord revealed himself as a Healer in the book of Exodus, just days after the Israelites fled slavery and mistreatment in Egypt. God had afflicted many serious plagues on the Egyptians to bring about the Israelites’ release from oppressive slavery. But make no mistake: The relationship between Israelites and Egyptians hadn’t always been a negative one. The Egyptians’ jealousy, idolatry, and oppressiveness drove them to a point where God allowed them to experience the negative consequences of their sin in order to bring Israelite freedom.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God wanted the Israelites to experience the healing that the Egyptians didn’t receive through their choices, and today He wants that for us, His people. There is a direct correlation between walking in obedience to God, spending time in His presence, and finding healing and peace from wounds and burdens. A while ago I was sick and spent some time in the hospital. When it was time to be discharged, I listened to specific instructions from the medical staff to know how to take my medicine and what level of activity I should have. Their advice was good, and by implementing the doctors’ orders, I was healthy again after a couple months. We’re no different in our walk with God. In order to heal, we must follow the Great Physician’s instructions. Some of the most freeing steps that I have taken in my life have been small steps of obedience where I chose to live my life for the Lord and not conform to this world. Daily time in the Word of God has lifted my burden of guilt, cleared my mind and brought me enormous joy in my marriage. God promises to do the healing work in us if we only put our gaze on Him and walk in His ways. His wise teaching and commands can give us healthy souls.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Who can heal my broken heart after a bad breakup or tremendous grief? When my mistakes have corrupted me and I feel shame and guilt, who can forgive me and release me from this burden? The Lord, my Healer. God often demonstrates his power by healing physical ailments, through miracles and the incredible restorative healing processes of our physical bodies created by Him. But it goes much deeper than that: His spiritual and emotional healing capabilities are unmatched. God’s very character and nature are restorative.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection:</strong><br>What are my wounds and hurts? Are any of my family or professional relationships awry because I have not used God’s word to guide them? Are pains in my love life caused by disobedience and a lack of God’s purity in the way I handle my relationship? What instruction has God given me that I can obey today so that I can ultimately find healing?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer:</strong><br>I praise You, Lord, because You are so good! You forgive all my sins, you heal my diseases, and you redeem my life from darkness. Help me to hear your voice and walk in obedience to you. Let me experience Your full grace and restoration.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.”&nbsp;<em>(Psalm 119:105)</em><br>“And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man.”&nbsp;<em>(Luke 2:52)</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He was once a boy called Yeshua, prone to being overtired, the tummy bug, and perhaps a sweet tooth just like our own children. Recently, I’ve found myself wondering about his bedtime. Would his mom sit on the edge of his bed combing back the hair from his forehead with her fingers? Did she tell stories from her own childhood or remind him of the time he was found with the honey sticky from head to toe? All imagination, but how easy to overlook that the Son of God took on the form of a baby, who grew into a boy, and stretched into manhood touching every developmental age and stage while his mother nurtured him.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Recently, my family and I perched on a mountain top overlooking the bright Shenandoah Valley and the far reaching horizon where the Alleghany Mountains hide what’s beyond. Next to me sat our son and two daughters. It was one of those exceptional moments where my peace was punctuated by an awareness that their time with me is ultimately so short. The miles of gorgeous landscape below unfurled as a vivid reminder that we must help our kids see beyond themselves. Adults, we are called to illumine the shadows with the vision God has spoken over the next generation through His Word. We must teach our kids that in Jesus Christ they are chosen, blessed, anointed, equipped and marked with Kingdom purpose for His glory in that valley. As a result, their choices matter, their words matter, their lives matter in ways that far exceed what we can imagine.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Maybe that’s why I’ve been pondering young Jesus’ bedtime. His momma’s soft touch tucking loose strands of hair behind his ear, a candle highlighting the warmth in his sleepy eyes, a big yawn escaping from the boy Yeshua… Maybe she praised him for being patient with his sisters and encouraged him to be more responsible with picking up his toys. But most likely she told him how His Heavenly Father saw him – “Yeshua, the angel said to me, ‘He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High.’”&nbsp;<em>(Luke 1:32)</em>&nbsp;Imagine the boy curling closer to his mother’s lap as she rubbed his back recalling Zechariah’s words from years previous. “Yeshua, you will ‘give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.’”&nbsp;<em>(Luke 1:79)</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We have such a short time on the mountain top with our children. The mundane routine we have with them is our greatest opportunity to be our Heavenly Father’s echo. If you have the privilege of nurturing a child, be diligent in holding out the lamp of God’s Word as they move into the valley of life. Maybe that’s what Jesus’ mother did? She allowed holy words to shed light on her child’s path and cast vision for His life.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer:</strong><br>Heavenly Father, thank you so much for how You nurture me. Please help me share Your love with those entrusted to me. Your Word is a lamp to my feet. Help me to light their path with it as well that they may grow in wisdom and favor with You and others. In Jesus Christ’s mighty name I pray, amen.</p>

Read as he reminds us the importance of remembering those heroes that sacrificed their lives for our freedom.</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>A Little Memorial Day History&nbsp;</strong><br>It originated as Decoration Day in the years following the Civil War, and was the annual commemoration in which the graves of the war dead were decorated with flowers. It became an official federal holiday for America in 1971, and is observed on the last Monday of May. Memorial Day is to honor the U.S. military men and women who died while serving in combat. The partial list below comes from the U.S. Veteran’s Affairs casualty data on battle deaths by conflict:</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>53,402 World War I (1917-1918)<br>291,557 World War II (1941 –1945)<br>33,739 Korean War (1950-1953)<br>47,434 Vietnam War (1964-1975)<br>148 Persian Gulf War<br>(Desert Shield/Desert Storm) (1990-1991)<br>6,900+ Global War on Terrorism (2001 to present)&nbsp;</strong></p>

<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For some these numbers are more personal. On one of my deployments during a mission I lost an entire helicopter crew. Instantly, 6 wives become widows, and 18 children were fatherless.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br>“Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of our God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.”&nbsp;<em>(-James 1:27, NASB)</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We are all part of an amazing church body that has a mission to Love God, Love People, and Love Life. We accept challenges all the time to afford God the opportunity to show his grace, mercy, and power. This weekend, can you carry out this mission by recognizing those who’s loved ones died for our freedoms? For my family, no matter where we are stationed, we drive to the nearest National Cemetery to clean up the grounds and place flags. It is a small gesture, but important for us to remember those we have lost in combat. We also reach out to our Gold Star Families to comfort them and share stories of their loved ones lost.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>This Memorial Day take a moment during the extra-long weekend to break away from the sale at your favorite store, or your famous BBQ, and pray for the families left behind. Be humble as it is a day to remember military service men and women who died while defending this great nation, and not a celebration or “happy” Memorial Day. It is also not the day for recognizing Veterans (November 11th), or our First Responders (October 28th). While incredibly important, this is not that day. It is the day to reflect on those that lived John 15:13 out to the fullest: “Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends”<br><em>(-John 15:13, NASB)</em>.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Heavenly Father,<br>Thank You for our One Nation Under God. Thank You for those that have laid down their lives for this nation in the service of its military. Lord, encourage us to seek out opportunities to share your love with the widows and children of the fallen. Lord, empower us to emulate your perfect example in your Son, Jesus Christ. Lord we pray you watch over our military and continue to bless the United States of America. In Your Son’s name we pray.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">– Amen</p>

  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Every summer, The Point relocates to PVCC (Piedmont Virginia Community College) to the Dickinson Building. This summer, we will move there on June 17th, which happens to be this Sunday! Our time at PVCC every year is always special, as we get to change up our format a little bit. This year is no different, and we’ve got some great plans for The Point while we are there. You’ll have to be there to experience it all, so I won’t give too much away on this blog!</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">While excitement accompanies change, quite often fear and anxiety accompanies change as well. I think about what Israel must have felt as they were moving through the wilderness for 40 years, trying to make a temporary home every chance they could. I think of the Levites, and how they would have to pack up the tabernacle (which was the tent where they worshipped), move it, and set it up again over and over and over. The fact that they didn’t have five 24ft trailers to move their worship environment just makes it even more complicated!</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">There are stories of Israel on the move all in the Old Testament books of Exodus, Numbers, Judges, and Joshua. But one thing was for sure… where they went, the Spirit of the Lord went as well. God ordained their journey, and was always with them. The same is true for the church, and for The Point. Where we go, the Spirt of the Lord goes as well.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You’ll see the Spirit at work in the auditorium as our adults worship, and hear powerful messages from the parables of Jesus. We’ve got an incredible series called “The Storyteller” kicking off this Sunday.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You’ll see the Spirit at work in our students, as StudentLife will be gathering each week at PVCC to grow in God’s Word through their large-group time, and their small-group time.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You’ll see the Spirit at work in KidsPoint, as our children worship and engage in crafts and lessons that teach them Gospel-truths. Kids will absolutely love the environments we’ve prepared for them this year at PVCC.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We as a staff are so excited about what God will be doing over these seven weeks at Piedmont Virginia Community College. Be sure to join us every Sunday at PVCC, 9:30am or 11:00am. You can join us online each week as well, on our website or on our app. We’ll see you this Sunday!</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">For more information, visit&nbsp;<a href="http://thepointva.com/">thepointva.com</a></p>

  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><em>Today’s blog is written by Stu Poindexter. Read as he shares with us the importance of leaning on God to train up our children.</em><br><br><br><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“Train up a child in the way he should go, even when he is old he will not depart from it.” -Proverbs 22:6&nbsp;</em></p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><em>“Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or tremble at them, for the Lord your God is the one who goes with you. He will not fail you or forsake you.” -Deuteronomy 31:6</em></p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Last weekend, my family celebrated the marriage of my nephew at a wedding that I’ll never forget. It was beautiful, joyful, and fun. In one of the most memorable moments of the evening, I had the opportunity to dance with my thirteen-year-old daughter. As I pulled her onto the floor to the first notes of “My Girl,” she wasn’t worried about what people were thinking; she wasn’t embarrassed by me or by our dance (which might be outside of her character these days). Instead, it felt like we were dancing alone in the kitchen when she was little enough to stand on my feet, when I would spin her around and her giggle would fill the room. There was so much joy radiating from her when she could dance with her daddy. I couldn’t help but tear up a little as the reality set in that I would one day far too soon be dancing with her on her wedding day.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I’ll never forget how I felt as the nurse placed my daughter in my arms for the first time. It was the perfect combination of joy, excitement, and fear. I knew from that moment that there was absolutely nothing that could separate her from my love. She was mine. The Lord has blessed us with this precious gift and we would have the privilege of teaching her to love Him. But I didn’t know anything about raising a child. What would happen if I messed up? How would I know all of the answers? Would I be able to figure out what she needed when she was too young to communicate? Those are just some of the questions spinning through my head at that moment.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Here we are thirteen years later and I still don’t have all of the answers, but there are two truths I know for sure: 1. Parenting is hard, y’all. Like really hard. 2. The Lord has my back, even in things that seem particularly challenging. There is no need to be afraid because God is with me and will not leave me, even when I’m facing something really scary… like a teenage girl.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You see, as much as we love our children, God loved them first and He loves them even more. As a parent, I take comfort in knowing that I can always turn to my Heavenly Father for advice. In my darkest parenting moments, He calms my spirit, gives me the words to say, and reminds me that this is a season. There is no such thing as a perfect parent, but if we lean on Him, God will equip us to raise our children in a way that honors Him.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Father God, thank you for entrusting our children to us, and for giving us help and wisdom when we don’t know how to parent them. Thank you for Your grace when we stumble and fall short of the parent you created us to be. Most importantly, help us, Father, to raise our children to love You, honor You, and share that same love with others. In Jesus’s name I pray, Amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><em>Today’s blog is written by Janice Cappucci. Here she shares Carole Olson’s story – a word to sustain the weary.</em><br><br><br><em>“Therefore, confess your sins to each other and pray for each other<br>so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is<br>powerful and effective.” -James 5:16 NIV</em></p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It’s not often that hospital patients under general anesthesia can hear their doctors speaking to each other during surgery. And perhaps it’s just as unusual for a patient with a painful, paralyzing tumor on her spine to go into surgery with a total sense of peace, able to convey her utmost confidence to her surgeon beforehand.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But that’s what happened to Carole Olson after she emailed The Point requesting prayer for her upcoming surgery. It all started several years ago with painful feelings of pins and needles in her toes. Then some time later her knees started buckling. Then her hip would freeze – paralyzed with pain. “Why did you wait so long?” her neurologist asked. She really didn’t have an answer, except the hope it would resolve itself on its own.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Or maybe it was because she is a registered nurse. Nurses see it all – surgeries that work out well, where the surgeon operates on the right body part, etc. – and others that don’t.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When her neurologist expressed alarm at her CT scan, and shuffled his scheduled surgeries to get her in post haste, she knew she needed lots of prayer.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">“God was in this every step of the way,” Carole said. “We have wonderful prayer warriors at The Point. They touch God.” Despite the size of the tumor and its risky entanglement of her nerve bundles – and despite feeling apprehensive about past surgeries, Carole found herself feeling completely relaxed, with no fear, and complete faith all was going to be fine.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It was more than fine, actually. So fine the doctor was stunned at what happened during surgery. The first surprise came when he saw that the tumor had actually shrunk since the CT scan. Second, even though the tumor had come so close to penetrating her spinal cord it left a dimple, it did not break through, sparing Carole a world of trouble. And then, when he set out to peel the tumor off her nerve bundles, it simply fell off clean into his hands.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">He was so amazed, and spoke so loudly, Carole could hear him through the fog of anesthesia. “Look!” Carole remembers him saying. “This is like nothing I’ve ever seen before! I’m amazed!” Then Carole heard him speaking with the pathologist who examined the tumor. “He said his initial impression was it was clear – benign,” Carole said. And later lab tests confirmed that good news. “I knew all of that was God’s doing,” she said.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The effects of prayer continued after the surgery. Unlike past surgeries, Carole didn’t need so much as a Tylenol, much to the befuddlement of the nurses. One time, when she returned to her room, she found the nurses turning her room upside down. “They hadn’t ever cleaned or straightened my room before that,” Carole said, “but when I came in they were looking through a drawer.” Did they suspect she had a stash of her own pain killers hidden somewhere in the room?<br>It seemed like the only explanation. “They just could not believe someone with a six-inch incision could not be in pain. I know it was the prayer.”</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The blessings from the Body of Christ continued after Carole returned home. “I didn’t even ask for meals,” Carole said. “The Point’s Care Team just did it. People brought the most delicious food. It was heavenly.”</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Carole says unless you’ve been the recipient of that kind of care, you just don’t know what a blessing it is to receive meals. “We were totally blown away,” she said. “For two or three weeks we were well covered. It is such a blessing to have the Care Team ministry. I can’t wait till I can make meals for others.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">About a year ago, God began stirring in my heart a desire to go into ministry “full-time”. It feels silly to say it that way because I firmly believe all careers are a believer’s ministry but I knew God was calling me specifically to vocational ministry. I had ample time to prepare for this transition, however I am not sure anything could prepare me for what 2018 in ministry has looked like. Interning for the Next Generation has been the most stretching, challenging and rewarding work experience I have ever had. I guess I could sum up what I have learned so far through Micah 6:8, “He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God”.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Act Justly</strong><br>As an intern, I am given trust daily to make decisions for the Next Generation ministries. Decisions hold a lot of weight to me and I truly believe that each decision should be approached in prayer. I am not always diligent in this, but when a decision is produced through prayer, the Spirit is there. The greatest comfort of all in walking this life with God is the knowledge that as we are connecting daily with the Holy Spirit, we can be confident in our decisions to be carried out justly and gracefully. Not in our own power, but being led by His power. So, as I lean into that truth, I find peace and rest as I am challenged to make decisions big and small.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Love Mercy</strong><br>Ministry gets busy, the days fly by and I heard it put once “sometimes you feel like you are always just working for Sunday”. It can be so easy to get lost in the tasks. But the priority of every encounter and every thought should be kindness, compassion and empathy. This is what I have learned, people and relationships come first. I love God and because I love God I desperately love and ache for His people. So, in what sometimes feels like a whirlwind of a week, I want my actions and words to speak mercy. This is another discipline that is constantly being pruned through prayer and time with God.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Walk Humbly</strong><br>Pride breeds unrest and in turn gives Satan leverage to steal your joy. Humility is understanding that without God, we are nothing. This has been a crucial discipline to practice during my internship season. On my unrestful days, I find myself trying to manage everything on my own and then being brought to my knees and looking up at the face of Jesus lovingly waiting for me to give it all to Him. We have a loving God who since the beginning of time has desired us to have a posture of peaceful rest. He gives us the tools we need to do the work that He calls us to and then He simply asks in return for us to rest in Him. Acting in any other way is simply pride. However, in order to walk humbly, we must remain every moment in the One who is humility. Jesus.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So, what have I learned in the first six months of my internship? I need Jesus. A lot. I need Him to lead me in how I lead and make decisions. I need Him to center my heart daily on loving His people relentlessly and recklessly just as He continues to love us. Lastly, I need to live in humility. As Andrew Murray writes in his book Humility, “Humility is simply acknowledging the truth of our position as creature and yielding to God His place.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Dear Jesus, thank you for the never-ending connection we have with you to draw strength, direction, kindness and humility from. Help us to walk in the peace that you are the God who is working all things together for your glory and our good and we only need to be still and listen. Thank you for all that you are and all that we aren’t. Let us walk boldly in the power we have through the Holy Spirit to love and serve your people. In your holy name, amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I don’t know if it’s partly because of my personality, but I enjoy and am used to working behind the scenes. I don’t enjoy being thrown into the spotlight. I tend to cringe when my work is acknowledged. I would be perfectly content if no one knew what I did, but I have to acknowledge a part of me desires to be known and known for what I do. Do you know what it feels like to move in the unseen?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I think there is a human side of us that wants to not necessarily be recognized but to receive a stamp of approval. We all want to feel like our contribution is of value. We all want to feel like we are making a difference and that our work matters. Maybe you feel overworked and underappreciated, in some area of your life.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Maybe you feel it at home? Maybe you clean and take the kids from activity to activity and then finally get them to bed at the end of the day, and it goes totally unnoticed! Or maybe you work incredibly hard at your job and your boss doesn’t even recognize the time you put in and what it cost to accomplish what you did. Maybe you are a student and you work hard to study and get ahead of your assignments, but you continue to see bad grades and when you go to your professor for help it’s like they don’t even want to see you succeed!&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I want to encourage those who feel like this and say, your work, your effort and even the joy, positivity and love that you do it with has not gone unnoticed in the eyes of our King! When we are obedient to God’s call to steward the gifts He has given us, and to share those gifts within the body of Christ and outside of it, it is transformative! There is not one action that is too small that isn’t impacting the Kingdom of God! Whatever it is you do, in whatever environment remember that it is for an audience of one, our God.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If there is anything I’ve learned in this internship and working for The Point, it is that we all have a part to play that works for a greater vision than that of ourselves. So, when I sit behind a computer all day and the doubts come rolling in, “Is this social media post even going to make an impact? Does all this matter, Lord? Are we reaching anyone?”&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I can counter those thoughts with: “I am the hands and feet of My Father. I will be faithful with what is in front of me. I will do it and do it joyfully as unto Him. I will use the gifts and talents in me and I won’t hide them away. I won’t be fearful or doubt who He is creating and has created me to be. I will shine my light and I will be who He has called me to be.”&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Do you know what happens when we attach our self-worth to our work? Imagine a beautiful porcelain vase that was hand painted. Picture beautiful colorful flowers carefully arranged in that vase. Have you ever cleaned out a vase whose flowers are in the process of dying? When you take out the flowers what is left is old dirty, murky water. That is exactly what happens with us when we let our hearts go uncheck. Negative emotions quickly turn into negative beliefs and those beliefs produce decay that doesn’t just hurt how we view our selves. It even begins to taint the way we view our leaders, our boss, our spouse, our professors, and those around us. We produce new things constantly, flowers that are admired but eventually they get replaced. The treasured hand painted vase is not so easily replaced. Maybe not everyone notices the vase at first. Maybe not everyone knows it was hand painted and carefully picked out but, the owner and creator (God) does. He admires it. He admires us. He sees the beauty in us not our work. We are valuable because He has given us value.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So, I want to set a challenge before you. It is so easy to succumb to the frustration and stress of not feeling appreciated or the feeling that our work isn’t valued, BUT God doesn’t call us to do that! His Word gives us the example of what our attitude should be,&nbsp;<em>“Do everything without grumbling or arguing, so that you may become blameless and pure, ‘children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.’ Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain” (Philippians 2:14-16 NIV).</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Let us treat our doing like our being. Be the best God has called you to be. Don’t hide your light from the world. Our character and His Spirit inside you is on display—it is what you will be known for—not the accolades or the recognition! You will find purpose in what you’re doing when you shift the focus from being noticed to doing it for His glory. When we bring the Kingdom of Heaven to Earth, it doesn’t matter if others see us, because we know our Heavenly Father sees us, and He is proud of who we are, not what we do!&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Lord, help us to shift our focus from seeking value in our work to focus on our character, our motives, and attitude. Help us examine our hearts and surrender desires for affirmation from others to you. Let everything we do be done in love and for your glory. Amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Today’s blog is written by Lili Galvez. Read as she shares her experience on this year’s StudentLife camp trip!</em><br><br><br>Over the last few years, StudentLife has taken a trip to Myrtle Beach for a youth conference (known as Beach Camp.) However, after hearing feedback from many students, we wanted something more service based. This year I had the pleasure of joining many of our amazing students and leaders on a mission trip to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. We worked with an organization named YouthWorks, that partners with local organizations to meet ongoing needs in the Allison Hill community. Over the years this community has become impoverished and trash began building up in the neighborhoods. Everyday we were assigned a certain location and a project to fulfill in this neighborhood.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On Monday, the first day we started our projects, we met at the Mansion. This mansion is a home of an organization called WildHeart, and they hosted YouthWorks for their service project needs. My group’s first project was cleaning up a driveway with about four feet of trash. As soon as I stepped into the dirt, ants crawled up my legs and arms as we picked up the trash. Most of us were freaked out about those ants because soon it would lead to finding spiders, and eventually an opossum. Despite these minor setbacks, my heart was just filled with desire to finish the job, to restore the beauty that was once there, and to clean up as fast as I could to avoid thinking about more creepy, crawling creatures. It was tough labor, I’m talking about shoveling piles of dirt, pulling out mattresses, and loading heavy trash bags on and off trucks. This is not something I do normally on a day to day basis, and I know some other students felt the same way. This type of labor really allowed more opportunities to bond with one another and to encourage each other! We were all exhausted on the first day, but after seeing all the effort and progress we made, it gave us motivation for the next day.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Although, the work did not stop there, we also had the opportunity to help with breakfast, dinner, and your typical household cleaning chores. After dinner, we would meet as one big group and talk about how our day went. After worship and a message, all the churches involved had their own group time. This was one of my favorite parts of the day. Many of the students would share how they were truly feeling. Sometimes it seems better to hide our emotions to ourselves, to avoid vulnerability, but the students were willing to be open with everyone. Whether it was excitement, fear, or hope, everyone was listening and supporting our friends. I couldn’t help but admire how our students are brave, hardworking, kind, and generous. Some of them were a lot younger than me, but the wisdom that they spoke blew me away. Not only did God stretch us out of our comfort zone, but I truly saw heart transformation in each and every one of us.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The last night of camp was amazing and that night is where I truly believed the students and I had our heart transformation. The YouthWorks hosts washed our leaders’ feet, and then the leaders washed our feet and prayed for us. I was a little self-conscious about having someone wash my feet, but the meaning behind this action is beautiful. Jesus washed the disciples’ feet to demonstrate humility and servanthood. It was an experience I will never forget because it left me in so much awe and wonder. I looked across the room and was just overwhelmed by the Lord’s presence and just how much he cares and loves us all. His presence was so powerful, some of the students began breaking down in tears. They were willing to let God enter their hearts and repair open wounds. I was so proud to see other students stepping up and surrounding their friends with love and encouragement.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I loved this trip so much because I had the chance to serve the Lord with new people in my life, and He began to stir in me new passions and desires. I have always loved working with children, but I am open to working with middle school and high school students when I am older. I also believe this trip gave all of us, (students and leaders) a new perspective of how we can reach our communities here at home. My hope is that we will have more volunteers in different areas at church, more attendance from students in REACH events, and more students participating in mission trips.<br><br><br><strong>We are so thankful for the what God is doing in our students through the StudentLife ministry!

      trip-to-cuba</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Today’s blog is written by Natalia Burton. Read as she shares her experience on the REACH Cuba trip!</em>&nbsp;<br><br><br><em>Our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with songs of joy. Then it was said among the nations, “The Lord has done great things for them.” The Lord has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy.<br>-Psalm 126: 2-3</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Going on a mission trip is something that had been on my heart for a long time. My daughter, Kaitlin, had shared that same stirring in her heart, so when the REACH trip to Cuba was announced at church one Sunday, we both immediately felt led to go. My biggest spiritual influence throughout my life, was my Cuban grandmother. She was on fire for the Lord, and never passed up an opportunity to share that enthusiasm and joy with others. It seemed only fitting that our first mission trip be to her homeland. I’m so thankful we made this decision because this trip was life-changing for both Kaitlin and me.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am excited to share that God is doing amazing things in Cuba. Here are just a few things I learned about the wonderful believers there:&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Relationships.</strong>&nbsp;The pace of life is slower in Cuba because the Cuban people are all about building relationships and connection. Meals would sometimes last for hours because we were on “Cuban time” – time spent truly getting to know and support one another, along with lots of stories, laughter, and lightheartedness.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Joy.</strong>&nbsp;There was so much joy in the Cuban people we worked with. Infectious joy, which I could feel from the first moment we walked into the church. Everyone greets each other with a kiss on the cheek, and a big smile.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Hospitality.</strong>&nbsp;The welcome we received wherever we went was so warm and inviting- from the homes where we stayed, to the church, and the many places we went during our visitations, we were received with love, kindness, and generosity. People wanted to love on and serve us, even though we were there to serve them. Even if they had very little, they wanted to share what they had with us. This was humbling and inspiring.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Gratitude.</strong>&nbsp;I Thessalonians 5:18 tells us to give thanks in all circumstances. I heard the words,&nbsp;<em>Gracias Señor</em>&nbsp;(meaning “Thank You, Lord”) both spoken and sung many times during our trip. The people we worked with truly gave thanks in all things and with sincerity.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our team started every morning with breakfast, prayer, and devotions. Each day we had different tasks- we visited the sick and elderly and prayed and shared verses with them. We organized, sorted, and distributed t-shirts World Help had donated, brought food to those in need, we did sports ministry for the youth, and Bible lessons and games with both the younger children and older youth. We spent time playing games and getting to know the church family. Members of our team participated in worship, prayed with church members, shared their testimonies, and I could see that though our lives are very different, the stories and experiences shared were relatable, and lives were touched.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We were privileged to be able to see up close the great work being done in Cuba by World Help and Go &amp; Tell Ministries. It was exciting to attend the 15th anniversary celebration of Go &amp; Tell ministries, where over 200 people packed into the church as Vernon Brewer delivered a powerful message on the saving power of Jesus Christ, and worship was beautifully led in both English and Spanish.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m incredibly grateful for our team. I see how God placed everyone on our team for a specific purpose. Everyone had different gifts to share. We really connected as a team and it was so nice starting each morning and ending each day together in prayer and reflection. I was impressed at how much our team members encouraged and built each other up throughout the week. Our leaders, Josh and Jessie, were phenomenal and made sure everyone had opportunities to share and serve.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sharing this first mission trip with my daughter was such a special experience, and we both grew deeper in our faith, and came back with a fire lit under us. We can’t wait to go back to Cuba and hope to go on many more REACH trips.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We are so grateful to be part of a church that is true to its mission to Love God, Love People, Love Life. The Point provides so many opportunities to live out this mission both in our own community and all around the world.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Dear God, thank you for your love for all your people, all over the world. Thank you for the blessing of work being done for your glory in Cuba, for the wonderful people serving you there, and for allowing us to partner with them. I pray that you would provide resources and opportunities for The Point family to reach more and more communities all over the world with the good news of Jesus Christ. We pray for all the upcoming REACH trips, and for those who are considering going on one, that they would trust your leading, and know that You will provide all they need if they make the decision to go. Thank You for loving us and empowering us to live our lives for You. In Jesus’s name, Amen.<br><br><br><strong>REACH mission trips are an amazing opportunity to be a part of what God is doing in the nations!

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you, casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.”<br>-1 Peter 5:6-7 ESV</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Every year in late July and early August we prepare for children and students to go back to school. Public schools, private schools, home schools and specialty schools, are all preparing for another school year, another group of students, and another set of joys, challenges, accomplishments, and failures.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As eager as I am to see the yellow buses making their morning and afternoon routes, I cannot help but feel the burden and weight that many others feel in anticipation of this new season. “What friends will my kid make? What issues will we run into this year? What if the worst happens?” Questions like these are exhausting and heavy and even if they might be real questions you have, in the end they generate an unhealthy burden that we are not meant to carry.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We are called to cast our anxieties on Him. He loves and cares for us and asks only that we humble ourselves under His mighty hand. So, my back to school prayer is just that.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration:underline">To the teacher/educator</span>, that you would have the strength and courage to speak grace and truth into the life of every student that God is trusting you with this year (Prov 15:2, 4).&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration:underline">To the parent/guardian</span>, that you would cast your insecurities on Him and trust the Holy Spirit with your child, praying hard and often for your children (1 Sam 1:27; Matt 19:13).&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration:underline">To the student/child</span>, that you would understand your need for Jesus, encourage your peers with positivity and a godly example (1 Tim 4:12) and impact the community around you by influencing your friend groups for the glory of God. And to the church, that you would encourage our younger family members and invest in them through prayer, relationship, and a godly role model (Luke 18:16; Eph 3:20-21).</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>What might God do in your life this year if you had no fear or worry? How might God be speaking to you now in a season of anticipation? Is God developing something within you, considering those around you?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br><em>Thank you Lord for your grace and truth; how it sustains me. Thank you for never abandoning me or leaving me in my sin. Search my heart and take my burdens. Rid me of my pride and selfish ambitions. Help me to live for you and lead the younger ones around me. In Jesus’ name; amen.</em></p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Today’s blog is written by Christine Smiley. Read as she shares her experience on the REACH Mexico trip!</em><br><br><br><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>He refreshes my soul. He guides me along the right paths for his name’s sake. -Psalm 23:3</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For years we talked about taking a mission trip. Yet, we never took it seriously as individuals or as a family. One day, we heard about another mission trip taking place with The Point. This was different. We promptly said “lets go”. We didn’t even know why we just felt God’s nudge pushing us forward. Ready or not Mexico here we come as a family!</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When Jacob was dying, he stated prophetic blessings on his sons. In Gen. 49:22, Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine near a spring, whose branches climb over a wall. In further scripture Jacob describes Joseph’s future is bountiful, thriving, walled-in garden planted next to a well. The garden is so lush the branches grow over the wall and reach out into neighboring areas. Jacob also states because his reach went beyond the walls, God will increase Joseph’s blessing. He was still hurt by many yet, he went beyond his walls.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We prayed individually for God to show us how we can minister to others. With open hearts we were off. God showed us how to minister to others and much more! He not only opened my heart in ways I never expected but, he showed me where I needed to go beyond my walls. I shared with the team one morning I was embarrassed, I had an impatience before arriving with those of other languages. I never realized. But, one evening as two talented ladies sang simultaneously one in spanish and one in english God whispered to me both voices sing to me and I hear both. I broke. From that moment I knew I needed to get out of my box and begin to reach out to more people. This includes more mission trips but, also all around me. This is one example how God used this trip to minister to me.There were countless others with our family and the entire team.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We spent a week with a missionary family. We lived a week in their everyday lives. We witnessed first hand how many hours they invest in the ministry. From building a roof on a kitchen and a bathroom for a ministry that gives food to the children, helping with VBS, to going in a village where some have never heard of Jesus and inviting them to the pop up church service we were holding in their village. By the end of the week, we did not want to leave what we saw God doing in Mexico and his people.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Lord, I pray each person goes beyond their walls.I pray an increased blessing over each as they share what God has done for them. I pray you give us a boldness to send a vine out to others to share Jesus and not keep him to ourselves. In Jesus name, Amen.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Are you interested in going on one of the REACH mission trips?

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Today’s blog is written by Hunter Long. Read as he shares about his experience volunteering with the special needs ministry.</em><br><br><br>For the past several months I’ve been helping with the special needs ministry at the point. I started out by volunteering in KidsPoint as a helper and did that for a while before I was asked about being a buddy for Lily, a girl in KidsPoint with Down Syndrome. I agreed to help, but to be honest I was kind of nervous because I didn’t feel qualified. I had never really helped with special needs kids or kids in general that much, and I felt really unsure of myself. However, as time went on I realized that interacting with Lily isn’t really different than helping out with any other child. There are a few differences, as Lily is more sensitive to loud sounds and sensory overload, and it is more important for her to have structure and schedules. But she loves to play and have fun just like anyone else does. As time has gone on I’ve gotten to know Lily and her sweet personality even more. She has a really good sense of humor and loves to sing and dance. Sometimes she is fine staying with the other kids at Kids Point, and other times she prefers to be by herself.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Something that has been very helpful for me is how involved Lily’s mom has been from the very start. When I first started helping she gave me and the other helpers a pamphlet that introduced us to Lily and provided a lot of great information about what to expect and how to help Lily succeed. She also asks about how things are going with Lily and offers helpful suggestions. This might not seem like a big deal, but her involvement has made me feel so much more confident in being Lily’s buddy.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Through volunteering with Lily, I feel like I have learned a lot about how God can use us, even if we don’t really feel qualified or gifted in a certain area. All that He asks of us is that we be faithful and willing to let Him work through us, and He will provide the rest.<br><br><em>“And they were bringing children to him that he might touch them, and the disciples rebuked them. But when Jesus saw it, he was indignant and said to them, “Let the children come to me; do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.” &nbsp;And he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands on them.”<br>-Mark 10:13-16</em><br><br><strong>Prayer&nbsp;</strong><br>God, I am so thankful that you ask us to come to you humbly like children. You don’t ask that we be capable in every way, but rather that we would allow you to use us and work through us in spite of our weakness. Help us to depend fully on your grace each day, and not to allow fear to prevent us from following you. Thank you for making your strength perfect in our weakness. In Jesus’ name; amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">What does prayer have to do with hearing God’s Voice? Everything.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><em>“Pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people.”<br>-Ephesians 6:18</em></p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Want to grow with God? Pray.<br>Want to learn to hear His Voice? Pray.<br>Want to learn to pray? Pray.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When do many people really grow in faith and their relationship with God? When they are in trouble. I know I did. At that point, you either lean in to God, or you pull away. I don’t know about you — but my most real prayers were in desperate moments when I actually surrendered and accepted that only God could help.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Pastor Gabe is teaching a powerful series about hearing God’s Voice. Prayer builds your relationship with God as much as anything in the universe. To pray is to begin a dialogue with God that grows and grows, “from glory to glory” (2 Cor. 3:18) for the rest of your life. In God, you have a trusted Friend, Advocate, Father, Advisor, Provider, Protector, and so much more. Praying is not another “chore” or “to-do”. It is your life! Prayer is pure comfort and joy. Prayer and praise is what God created you for; it’s why He chose you!</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">There are many things that I don’t think any of us can fully know about prayer, until we see Jesus face-to-face. However, there are a few things that I’m fairly sure of:</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">1. Some things will not happen unless we pray.&nbsp;<em>“You do not have because you do not ask.” -James 4:2b</em></p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">2. Some things are going to happen with or without our prayers and actions — but God specifically wants us involved, and we can be if we choose to obey Him. Mordecai told Queen Esther in Esther 4:14, that God would deliver the Jews with or without her. Pastor Gabe has said, “God is doing something, and we want to be a part of it.” I don’t want to miss it, do you?</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">3. Prayer is not like having a spiritual temper tantrum until God does what you want. Sometimes God’s answer is no. Sometimes He will redirect your prayers.&nbsp;<em>“This is the confidence which we have before Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.” -1 John 5:14&nbsp;</em></p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">4. Prayer, like any conversation, is a two-way street. If my “prayer” is only a quotidian list of my wants and needs, I’m not really sure that’s prayer at all. Would you have a flat, “wants and needs” conversation with any person with whom you have a real relationship? True prayer is heart-to-heart. True prayer is listening, as much as it is speaking. Like any good communication, silence is allowed between the two parties. Sitting in silence before God, when He has your full attention, is a powerful thing. Let Him speak to you and minister to you. With words, and deep heart-to-heart without words… He made you; He doesn’t need a translator. You are safe. And He will not be rushed; this is on His terms. We miss so much when we hurry in prayer.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">5. Sometimes the most eloquent prayer is a tear. It’s a language that God knows very well. I think that tears are part of the “groanings too deep for words” -Romans 8:26. I believe that those tears, heart-cries and wordless moments are love languages in His eyes. God is attracted to pain, vulnerability, desperation and naked honesty.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">6. Prayer is fragrance before God. It is kept as bowls of incense in Heaven; that’s how precious our prayers are to God! (Revelation 5:8)</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">7. The Holy Spirit leads us in prayer. There are times on the Prayer Team, when we minister to people with devastatingly complex problems. God really doesn’t need my list of sequential how-to’s, to handle it. He’s got it; our part is simply to cry out to Him. Many times, the Holy Spirit will just lead me to pray the name of Jesus. God tunes His ear to any desperate soul who acknowledges that He is God and is the only one who can fix it!</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">8. Aim to praise God (that’s a strong type of prayer) twice as much as you ask God. Don’t we all tune our ears when we receive praise? We are made in His image, and from Genesis to Revelation — it is clear that God loves praise! A heart of gratitude always begets more things to be grateful for!</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">9. Why corporate/group prayer? Corporate prayer does not replace personal prayer, and vice versa. Jesus says that there is power in corporate prayer (Matthew 18:19-20). He would not have said that, if it was enough to pray individually.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>We are praying people at The Point. This church exists because Pastor Gabe and Kari fasted and prayed to seek God’s direction, provision, and confirmation that this was what God was telling them to do. Let us continue in prayer, individually and as a body. Every Sunday, and in many groups all across town, just like we do.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Every Thursday night, Greg Webber and I are leading a prayer group from 6:30-8pm, at the church office. We seek as many miracles, healings, returned prodigals, careers, restored marriages, direction, guidance, spiritual growth, babies born, freedom from addictions, hearts changed, forgiveness given and received, salvations, building projects, favor, mission trips, financial provision, and on and on and on, that we can possibly have. Let us ask together, and see what God will do! To learn more, please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://thepointva.com/groups/">thepointva.com/groups</a>.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Father, if You never did another thing for me in my entire life, I will never be able to thank You enough for all You have already done! I pray that You continue to quicken my heart to turn to You more and more with praises, needs, and basically everything. Father, guide me in how You want me to pray the things that You want me to pray. In Jesus’ Name, amen.</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Today’s blog is written by Marvin Scoggin. Read as he shares how joining a group has impacted his life and walk with God.<br><br><br><em>“Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful. And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.” -Hebrew 10:23-25.</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ve been in a number of small groups as a Christian: young single men, married couples, mixed age co-ed, mixed age men. Without question, small groups have been a vital part of my Christian life. Meeting as a church is one response to the verses above, but “stirring up one another” truly fits the nature of a small group. In that smaller setting, you come to know others in more than a “how’s it goin’” sort of way and can genuinely stir up each other to love and good works and encourage each other as The Day draws near for Christ’s return.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As a college student, I thought being a Christian meant behaving yourself while waiting in the station for that train that takes you home to heaven. But during my sophomore year, five single-syllable words changed the course of my life:&nbsp;<strong>“Come help change the world.”</strong>&nbsp;Through a complete stranger who became a lifelong friend, I became active with a small group of guys in an Action Group with Campus Crusade for Christ (now called CRU).</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We became tight-knit friends who played together (my nose is still crooked from a game of “touch” football), pranked together (shaving cream on the telephone earpiece; getting doused with a trash can of water just because), prayed together, studied the Bible together, encouraged each other to be men of virtue, and shared our faith with anyone who would listen, from classrooms to fraternities to one-one-one. With these precious brothers, I became a campus activist—in the best sense of the word.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Before moving to Virginia last year, I was part of a large (15,000) Southern California church. It was common to hear, “Groups make a big church small.” Once I became part of a group, I was surprised how often I ran into people I knew in the huge throngs. They just seemed to stick out. Year after year, I met men of all stations and all walks of life, some whose past included drug use/dealing, sexual immorality, murder, and all manner of wrongdoing for which some were on probation. They would laugh when I said, “I used to use Aleve every day.” But we all had one thing in common: We were sinners saved by grace through faith, and out of that developed a strong bond and affection for each other.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What about you? By joining a small group at The Point, you can . . .</p><ul data-rte-list="default" style="margin-left:40px;"><li><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Make close, enduring friendships that help you grow as a Christian.</p></li><li><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Be transparent and honest with people who share the same faith and a commitment to living in ways that are effective and fruitful in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus. (2 Peter 1:8)</p></li><li><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Be sympathetic and circumspect: “There, but for the grace of God, go I,” instead of “I would never do that.” (Cf. Galatians 6:1)</p></li><li><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Find encouragement and support to do what’s right by God’s standard and to steer clear of (or stop doing) what’s wrong.</p></li><li><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Strive to become a person of virtue, knowledge, self-control, steadfastness, godliness, brotherly affection, love.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Today’s blog is written by Alex Timmons. Read as she shares about her experience on the Set Up Dream Team.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another”<br>-Galatians 5:13 ESV</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One of the things I love about the Point is that there are so many opportunities to serve that it is easy to find something that works for you. Personally, I have found my serving niche as part of the Set-Up Dream Team. This means I get to church on Sunday mornings at 7:00am, and honestly – I love it (and I’m not particularly a morning person either).&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sure, don’t get me wrong, there are some weeks (okay most weeks) when my alarm goes off on Sunday morning, and it’s a real struggle to get out of bed. The temptation to continue hitting snooze is almost overwhelming. What ultimately gets me out of bed on those mornings is one of the reasons why I serve: it helps me to practice being faithful in the little things. This is a topic Pastor Gabe hits on quite often, so it has been resonating with me over the past few months. Instead of always expecting God to work in our lives in big dramatic ways, we first have to learn to be faithful in the everyday, little things. Getting up early on Sunday mornings, especially the Sundays where I don’t feel like it, is just one way that I can live this out.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Another reason I serve is for the opportunity it gives me to build relationships with fellow believers. Through my Dream Team experience at the Point, I have met and built relationships with people I would not have met if I were just coming to service on Sundays. It has been so enriching to my personal walk with the Lord to be around other believers.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Also, something really cool happens when you start getting involved in the work that the Lord is doing around you – you get to be a part of something bigger than yourself. This brings me to the final reason I serve: it reminds me that in the end it is not about me. I am human. I am imperfect. I have flaws. But ultimately, none of that matters when I come and lay my efforts at the feet of Jesus through service. It gives me the freedom to forget about myself and my imperfections and just focus on serving the Lord. He takes my unique skills, gifts, and personality, and He couples them with the work of fellow believers who have done the same. He magnifies our efforts to achieve things far greater than I could ever hope to accomplish through my own effort alone. To be a part of that and see it unfolding around me is so much more powerful than any extra hour of sleep on a Sunday morning could ever be.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Lord, I thank you for the opportunity to live for something greater than myself. I pray that you would help me to humbly and faithfully present my efforts to you Lord so that you can use them for your glory. Amen</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Last month, I went back to Guatemala for the fourth time with our mission team from The Point. This trip was different than any before. Honestly, they always are. For me, this was my first time going as a father. I have a sixteen-month old daughter and my wife, and I are expecting baby number two in January 2019. I was also asked to co-lead the group. This meant not only using my gifts with chiropractic to adjust all the people we encountered but to also keep my eyes, ears and heart open to our team.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This trip was also challenging because it was the official end of our five-year Village Transformation Project in Curva del Pino. In this village, God has used all of us who have gone. Not just the missionaries on the dozens of trips, but also the prayer warriors back home and the generous donors that helped fund the trips. All of us played essential parts in the success of the mission. Buildings have been built. Families have been restored. Lives have been saved through this mission. The eternal impact will certainly be greater than any of us can ever imagine. It was hard to say goodbye. There are many families that still have great needs. Part of me felt torn knowing that we were shifting gears to help another village when there is always more we can do at Curva del Pino. I knew that this other village, Timiluya, was in even worse shape than Curva del Pino was five years ago. However, we know that God has a plan there.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So the last two days of our trip we journeyed in the opposite direction up a mountain to the village of Timiluya. We encountered people that desperately needed the gospel of Jesus Christ and the love that we can show in His name. As we prayer walked throughout part of the village, many of us were overwhelmed by the drastic physical needs of the village that were so evident. We did what we knew we could and that was to pray.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God gave me a word from Isaiah 59:1 that morning. This verse was comforting. God knew what he had in store for Curva del Pino and he knows what he has in mind for Timiluya. The people in the village of Timiluya have been forgotten about by their region, state and country. God however is strong enough. He cares about these people and desires their hearts to cry out to him for Jesus. He has heard their laments and God sent us to this village so that he can work through us. That means all of us who go and all of us who send. All of us are a part of this international mission work. Every prayer matters. Every dollar matters. Every tear matters. God cares about it all. We are all either going or sending. Thank you, church, for being a part of God’s work in Guatemala!&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Indeed, the Lord’s hand is not too short to save, and his ear is not to deaf to hear.”<br>-Isaiah 59:1 NIV</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Father, thank you for calling and equipping us for your kingdom work. Thank you for the lives that have been transformed and those that you continue to pursue. Father, we seek you for a physical and spiritual transformation in Guatemala, specifically these two villages that you have brought to our attention to partner with. Let your love reign and the name of Jesus abide in their hearts forever. Amen!&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>If you are interested in joining us on one of our REACH mission trips visit&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://thepointva.com/going-and-sending/%20%E2%80%8E"><strong>thepointva.com/reachcountries</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;for more information about upcoming trips!</strong></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Today’s blog was written by Mary Anna Wu on prayer.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“…Samuel was lying down in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was. Then the Lord called Samuel. Samuel answered, “Here I am.” And he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.” But Eli said, “I did not call; go back and lie down.” So he went and lay down again… The Lord called Samuel a third time, and Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.” Then Eli realized that the Lord was calling the boy. So Eli told Samuel, “Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say ‘Speak Lord, for your servant is listening,’ So Samuel went and lay down in his place. The Lord came and stood there, calling as the other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” Then Samuel said, “Speak, for your servant is listening.” 1 Samuel 3:3-10</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A few years ago, when I found myself battling insomnia for weeks on end, I was extremely challenged. I would start the night well, and somewhere around 2:30 a.m. my mind would activate and I’d spend the next several hours tossing and turning, miserable, and becoming increasingly distressed about my ability to function the following day. I prayed, “God, what is wrong with me? Please let me rest!” During this long season of sleeplessness, I couldn’t understand why God, who obviously created me with a need to sleep, wouldn’t help me get the rest I so desperately wanted. I learned that 3:30 a.m. is the stillest, most isolating time in the world. No other soul is around and if they are, they don’t want to talk at that hour.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Somewhere around this season, the Lord reminded me of the story of Samuel, where He spoke to the boy in the night. Could it be possible that I, like Samuel, was awake because the Lord was talking to ME? Up until this point in my life, I had generally viewed prayer as a one-sided conversation. I would do all the talking, expected that God was likely listening and at some point would make the events unfold that needed to happen. Sort of like business email: I expected to get a canned follow-up response later. But lying prostrate in the dark during this season, the thoughts of my heart, profound words of Scripture, personal conviction, and piercing, loving truth that can only come from God was blaring inside of me. “Oh, so I am awake at this time because You want to talk to me!” I realized.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This was a game-changer for me. While I really wanted sleep badly, God finally had my attention. There was nowhere else for me to go, and now I knew to listen and ask questions about my anxious thoughts, my failures, circumstances with my family, and even the most confusing scriptures I had read. God responded to me at night with peaceful, coherent words into my heart. I would wrestle through my complaints against God and He would answer them with healing. Being so on-the-go during the daytime, I had not cultivated a way to listen. Too many voices impeded my hearing. But not in the middle of the night. At night, everything else was quiet but God.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Is He speaking to you, too?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer:</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lord, I don’t want to have just one-sided conversations with You. I want to hear what You are saying. Speak, for Your servant is listening.</p>

      <title>Breakthrough to Freedom</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/1/22/breakthrough-to-freedom</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On February 16th we are having our annual Women’s Conference and I am so excited about this year’s theme…Breakthrough. We have been praying, planning and preparing for an incredible day. I want to encourage you to mark your calendars now and to register online for this power packed day of teaching, worship and hearing from the Lord. (<a href="http://thepointva.com/breakthrough">thepointva.com/breakthrough</a>). As women, we all need moments to slow down, reset, and spend time focused on self-care in the Lord. One of the ways I like to spend time with the Lord is through worship. Many times, God uses music to speak to my life situations and allows me to see how He wants to grow and develop my love for his guidance, direction and breakthrough.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Last year one of my favorite worship songs was “New Wine” by Brooke Ligertwood. She starts off with these words:</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>In the crushing, In the pressing, You are making new wine</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>In the soil I now surrender, You are breaking new ground</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is something that struck a chord in my heart to hear her sing of the crushing and pressing that creates new wine. And then she goes to sing about how new ground emerges when I surrender.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Last year I was in a season of&nbsp;wanting and feeling like I needed all of the details laid out in front of me if I were to survive that season. One year ago, the months began to snowball one right into the next. My mother became incredibly ill and passed away, and less than 30 days later my oldest son joined the Army. I felt like I could handle my mom’s passing because she was secure in her salvation and I had nothing to fear or be concerned about. She was at complete peace with her Jesus. My son, on the other hand, was embarking into unknown territory. I was not raised around the military, I didn’t have personal friends who were connected to the military, and I didn’t quite understand the role I would play as a military mom.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As the spring progressed and it was time for my son to leave for Basic Training, I was consumed with worry, fear, sadness, and at times Satan threw in a good dose of regret. I was not sure how I was going to get through 10 weeks of my son being transformed from a Civilian into a Soldier. If it were not for a group of strong Army Moms that I met online, I would have spent the remaining weeks in a pit of depression. God knew I needed a strong network of women who had walked this journey before me to help keep me focused. There came a point when one of the women reminded me to hold tight to my faith and to remember the promises God had already given me regarding my children.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Merriam-Webster Dictionary describes “breakthrough” as:&nbsp;<em>an offensive military assault that penetrates and carries beyond a defensive line; related to warfare.&nbsp;</em>When I think back to where I was last summer, I could have allowed Satan to win the battle in my mind. There were days when my peace was challenged, when my worship shifted to worry and back, when the focus of my joy was my situation. As I ponder this definition of breakthrough it leads me to believe that breakthrough occurs through–and as a result of–a series of events. For years, I believed that breakthroughs only occurred in an instant. For some people they do, and for others, breakthroughs can be a process. I have come to realize God is part of the progressive breakthrough as much as He is part of the instant breakthrough. Likewise, the making of new wine is not an overnight or instant process. The process of my breakthrough was not overnight. It took persistence to hold on to my peace. It took persistence to keep worship music playing in my car, when I was getting ready in the mornings, when I sat in my office at work, and even some nights when I had to have worship music playing while I slept to protect my sleeping hours.&nbsp; I had to take an offensive stance against the spiritual warfare that was sent out against me.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My favorite song continues:&nbsp;<em>Where there is new wine, There is new power. There is new freedom.</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I think of new ground, I am also reminded of the many times God said in his word that He would give his children new territory, new land overflowing with milk, honey, and new wine. All this is a new season, a time in which God wants to do something brand new in our lives. This newness cannot be stuffed back into something that is old, used, and worn out. In Luke 5:37-38, Jesus says, “And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed, but new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.”&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As I moved through the summer, I emerged with a greater sense of what it meant to be a Military Momma. I emerged with a greater awareness of the spiritual and physical battles that wage war on the women around me. I emerged with a greater awareness to pray for women near and far, some of whom I may never meet.&nbsp; It has not been an easy journey. I continue to have moments where I become overwhelmed with wonder. There is a new sense of freedom that comes with this new season. I am free to trust God with my thoughts, plans, dreams, and desires. I don’t need to know all the details because God remains faithful and true to his Word. As I look back and compare those days to where I am now, I know without a shadow of doubt God is the God of My Breakthrough.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On February 16th, I invite you to join me and other women just like you for a one-day conference. There you will hear of God’s faithfulness in bringing about breakthroughs for women in Scripture as well as the women of The Point. We believe God has a special assignment for each of you as women in God’s Kingdom. He has equipped you and fashioned you for a purpose. He delights in you, and He wants to meet with you. Will you join us, worship with us, pray with us and simply lean in to listen to how God wants to propel you into your destiny?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Nicole Hawker</p>

      <title>Gaining Financial Peace</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/1/24/gaining-financial-peace</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Today’s blog is written by Jeff Pompeo who shares with us how important it is to be good stewards of what the Lord has given us!</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong><br><em>“I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it. 11 I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. 12 I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. 13 I can do all this through him who gives me strength. 14 Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles.”<br>-Philippians 4:10-14</em></p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Paul wrote these words as he sat in a prison cell condemned for his faith, awaiting an uncertain fate. This section of his letter was basically a ‘thank you note’ to the Philippian church, which had sent him a financial gift. It’s interesting that Paul “rejoiced greatly” in gratitude for the gift, but at the same time, demonstrated peace in knowing that the Lord was fully sufficient for all of his needs, even while unjustly imprisoned.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Paul paints a beautiful picture of how we are to live our lives, being content in all circumstances. While it’s easy be content when we have good health, happy families, and large bank accounts, it’s more challenging to find contentment when we are struggling financially, physically, or emotionally. It’s important however, that we don’t confuse “contentment” with “complacency”. God wants us to find contentment in knowing that He loves and provides for us, but He is also clear that we must plan and work to improve our circumstances to avoid becoming complacent.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Jesus uses the example of building a tower to teach us the importance of evaluating our circumstances and creating a plan for success. Luke 14:28-30 reads, 28 “Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won’t you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it? 29 For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you, 30 saying, ‘This person began to build and wasn’t able to finish.’<br>Jesus emphasized the importance of planning for the future as a way to achieve success; this concept applies to both our life and our finances. Having a plan is the key to success and the absence of a plan can quickly lead to complacency.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">From a financial perspective, do you have a plan? Do you have a budget? Do you control your money or does your money control you? Regardless of whether you earn $1,000,000 per year or $1,000 per year, whether you’ve got debts you can’t pay or you’ve got a huge savings account, the only way to achieve contentment is by recognizing that everything belongs to God and we are simply stewards of his riches. Our job is to manage God’s money and resources for His honor while we’re here on this earth. The Bible gives us many specific methods for being good managers of money, and putting this biblical principle into practice starts with some simple budget planning.<br>In Proverbs 16:9, Solomon wrote, “The heart of a man plans his way, but the Lord establishes his steps”. Everyone has hopes and dreams, but are you following the Lord’s instructional “steps”?</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If you’d like to learn more about God’s plan for money management, which includes specific actions for reducing debt, increasing savings, creating a budget, becoming more generous, and establishing a plan for success, please consider joining the next Financial Peace class at The Point. Financial Peace is a 9-week course from Dave Ramsay that will meet Monday evenings starting September 17. We’ve presented this video-based class at the Point four times over the past two years, and the nearly 100 people who have attended the group have cumulatively increased their savings by over $81,000 and paid off over $65,000 of debt! To learn more, please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://thepointva.com/groups/fpu/">thepointva.com/groups/fpu/</a></p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Think about your current financial circumstances. Are you properly managing God’s money for His glory? Are you at peace with your financial plan or is money a point of stress in your life? Do you talk openly with your spouse or accountability partner about your financial plan or does money cause angst and arguments? Do you control your money or does your money control you? Proverbs 22:7 says that the borrower is slave to the lender… Do you have a plan for freeing yourself from the burden of debt?&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Father, I am grateful for your living word, the Bible, which is my roadmap for life. I am thankful that you love me without bounds and provide me with all things. Please help me seek the contentment that Paul had, even from his prison cell, and help me create a plan to “build a tower” in my life. Help me to be a good steward of your kingdom on earth, and live a life that is pleasing to you.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Today’s&nbsp;blog&nbsp;was&nbsp;written&nbsp;by&nbsp;Janice Cappucci.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m so mad I could spit. First, my good-for-nothing kid brother comes home stinking like a pig sty, then my father throws a party for him. And I’m expected to join in. Outrageous.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I told my mentor from the synagogue, “Doesn’t Father realize I’m the one paying for this party? My brother already took&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;share of the inheritance. Everything that’s left is rightfully mine. That’s right – the wine, the bread, and especially that fatted calf – all of that is coming out of my inheritance. But Father thinks nothing of wasting it on that prodigal. Why can’t Father celebrate&nbsp;<em>me</em>? I’m the good son.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That’s what I asked my mentor. But you know what he had the nerve to say? Maybe I’m not as good as I think! Maybe self-righteousness is just as bad as throwing money at prostitutes.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Self-righteous!? What do you mean?” I said.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Think about why you’re angry,” he said. “You keep talking about the fatted calf, that you’ve worked hard – seemingly for nothing.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yeah … so?”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“So what does that reveal to you about your motives? Why were you working hard? Was it because you love your father? Or because you wanted his things?”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Well, I …”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Would it be fair to say your obedience was an attempt to control your father? And when that didn’t pay off, naturally, you got angry.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You make me sound so bad.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“My dear friend, aren’t we all bad?”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“How can you say that? Not just about me, but about yourself? I see you in the synagogue and your work in the community. You’re not like the scofflaws we see everywhere. And neither am I.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Does outward conformity to the law please God if it’s all about delighting in one’s ‘moral superiority’? Surely you remember hearing the Scriptures these past few months? ‘There is no one who does good, not even one.’”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Well, sure, no one is perfect, but tell me how I’m bad — working like a dog for my father. So yes, I deserve his wealth. I’ve earned every stinkin’ heifer in that pasture.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Brother – it pains me to say this – your sense of entitlement is damning evidence.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“– of what!?”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Like I said before – of self-righteousness – a struggle I know well myself.” Then seeing my face redden, he lifted his hand to my shoulder. “But let’s hold off discussing this any further tonight. How about if I send you home with just two Scriptures to read and ponder? Maybe the Lord will give you ears to hear. Would you be willing to spend some time reading and praying?”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Certainly. I read the Scriptures all the time, you know.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Of course,&nbsp;you do. But this week, do this for yourself: As you read these two verses,” he said, handing me two small slips of paper, “write out a prayer response to the Lord.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I tucked the verses in my bag, assuring him that whatever they said, I would return with keen insights and commentary for him next week.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Little did I know I was pocketing a little scalpel and a set of stitches. The next morning, I sat down to ponder these words:</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I will greatly rejoice in the LORD; my soul shall exult in my God, for&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;has clothed me with the garments of salvation;&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;has covered me with the&nbsp;<em>robe of righteousness</em>.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;The verses were familiar. But never before had I let them sink in. How penetrating they felt now! In my mind’s eye, I saw my younger brother wearing my father’s robe. And I saw how Father looked at him – like he was totally accepted and loved. And I saw my labors for what they were –&nbsp;<em>polluted</em>, self-serving, an attempt to earn approval and validation. What an insult to my father. As if his love was performance-based. As if he were that shallow.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I had to find him. I would write out my prayer response after I’ve made things right — after I’ve told him what a fool I’ve been. I found him and my brother, chowing down on some leftover veal sandwiches. It was just the two of them at the kitchen table, with Father’s robe draped carefully over my chair.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Hey! We’ve been hoping we’d see you today,” he said with a tentative grin. “We’ve saved some for you. Join us?”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Veal never tasted so good. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Janice Cappucci</p>

      <title>Pray First</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/1/31/pray-first</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It always means so much to hear what messages and message series have meant to our people, and never have we received as much feedback as we have with our Pray First series. This past Sunday we wrapped up this series, and if you weren’t able to be with us, or you missed a week or two, I want to encourage you to visit our website and catch up on the messages.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Many of you have requested a list of all the Scriptures that I referenced throughout this series. While these verses are some of the verses that I pray over myself each morning, there are many others that I did not share in the series. As you pray over yourself, the list below is a good starting point, but I would encourage you to search the Scriptures for yourself and ask God to give you specific verses in addition to these to use as a guide for prayer.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Here’s one last suggestion. After praying these verses over yourself each morning, carry the cards with you throughout the day and take 10 minutes over lunch, or while you’re waiting in line at the grocery store, or while you’re working out, and review the verses midday or later in the day as well. “With my lips I recount all the laws that come from your mouth.” –<strong>Psalm 119:13&nbsp;(NIV)</strong></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>BODY</strong></h3><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My son pay attention to what I say; listen closely to my words. Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart;&nbsp;for they (the words of God) are life to those who find them and health to a man’s whole body.&nbsp;<strong>Proverbs 4:20-22 (NIV)</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God—this is your spiritual act of worship.&nbsp;<strong>Romans 12:1 (NIV)</strong></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>MIND</strong></h3><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.&nbsp;<strong>Romans 12:2 (NIV)﻿</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.&nbsp;<strong>2 Corinthians 10:5 (NIV)</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.&nbsp;<strong>Philippians 4:8 (NIV)</strong></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>EYES</strong></h3><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I made a covenant with my eyes&nbsp;not to look lustfully at a young woman.&nbsp;<strong>Job 31:1 (NIV)</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My son, give me your heart&nbsp;and let your eyes delight in my ways, for an adulterous woman is a deep pit, and a wayward wife is a narrow well. Like a bandit she lies in wait and multiplies the unfaithful among men.&nbsp;<strong>Proverbs 23:26-28 (NIV)</strong></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>EARS</strong></h3><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Hear, Israel, and be careful to obey so that it may go well with you and that you may increase greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, promised you. Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.&nbsp;<strong>Deuteronomy 6:3-4 (NIV)</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So then, faith cometh by&nbsp;hearing,&nbsp;and hearing by the word of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Romans 10:17(KJV)</strong></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>TONGUE</strong></h3><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Reckless words pierce like a sword,&nbsp;but the tongue of the wise brings healing.&nbsp;<strong>Proverbs 12:18 (NIV)<br><br></strong>He who guards his mouth and his tongue&nbsp;keeps&nbsp;himself from calamity.&nbsp;<strong>Proverbs 21:23 (NIV)</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">From the fruit of his mouth a man’s stomach is filled;&nbsp;with the harvest of his lips he is satisfied. The tongue has the power of life and death,&nbsp;and those who love it will eat its fruit.&nbsp;<strong>Proverbs 18:20-21 (NIV)</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.&nbsp;<strong>Ephesians 4:29 (NIV)</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When words are many, sin is not absent, but he who holds his tongue is wise.&nbsp;<strong>Proverbs 10:19 (NIV)</strong></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>HEART</strong></h3><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Above all else, guard your heart,&nbsp;for everything you do flows from it.&nbsp;<strong>Proverbs 4:23 (NIV)</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have hidden your word in my heart&nbsp;that I might not sin against you.&nbsp;<strong>Psalm 119:11 (NIV)</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Your statutes are my heritage forever, they are the joy of my heart.<strong>&nbsp; Psalm 119:111 (NIV)</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I desire to do your will, my God; your law is within my heart.<strong>&nbsp; Psalm 40:8 (NIV)</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A cheerful heart is&nbsp;good&nbsp;medicine,&nbsp;but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.&nbsp;<strong>Proverbs 17:22 (NIV)</strong></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>HANDS</strong></h3><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve,&nbsp;and to give his life as a ransom for many.<strong>&nbsp;Mark 10:45 (NIV)</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Now strengthen my hands.<strong>&nbsp;Nehemiah 6:9 (NIV)</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Do you see a man skilled&nbsp;at his work?&nbsp; He will serve&nbsp;before kings; he will not serve before obscure men.<strong>&nbsp;Proverbs 22:29 (NIV)</strong></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>STOMACH</strong></h3><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you find honey, eat just enough, too much of it, and you will vomit.<strong>&nbsp;Proverbs 25:16 (NIV)</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is not good to eat too much honey, nor is it honorable to seek one’s honor. Like a city whose walls are broken through is a man who lacks self-control.&nbsp;<strong>Proverbs 25:27-28 (NIV)</strong></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>FEET</strong></h3><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”]<strong>&nbsp;Romans 10:15 (NIV)</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The steps of a man are established by the Lord, and He delights in his way<strong>. Psalm 37:23 (NASB)</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The man of integrity&nbsp;walks securely, but he who takes crooked paths will be found out.<strong>&nbsp;Proverbs 10:9 (NIV)</strong></p>

      <title>Peace Be With You</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.”</em> <strong>Philippians 4:6-7 (NIV)</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Each year when the leaves fall and the seasons change, I enter a state of seasonal depression. The darkness of the autumn months fills me with dread and sorrow that feels never-ending. Maybe it is because some of the most difficult moments in my life happened in the fall, or maybe it’s the physical darkness in the sky each morning when I leave for work and in the evening when I get home. Nevertheless, every year, without fail, the fall season brings about a terrible anxiety that I cannot shake - until last year.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In Fall 2018, I began to learn more about prayer and decided to be more intentional with my prayer life. I started attending the prayer group at The Point with that intention in mind. Little did I know, God would use that group to absolutely transform my life. In one of the first meetings, I shared a prayer request for myself and my mental being during the upcoming months and was immediately prayer for by name. I continued to ask for this prayer and soon after, found comfort in the verses from Philippians 4:6-7 to pray over myself.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Through prayer, God intervened in a big way in my life last fall. Instead of being filled with anxiety and lies from the enemy, I was filled with God’s supernatural peace and surrounded by community. “Peace be with you,” is a phrase I am very familiar with from growing up in the Catholic church, but it never meant more than a simple greeting. I never understood what God’s peace truly looked like until I got to know Him through intimate prayer. His peace fills my body and mind, and overflows into others. Because I have His peace, I no longer feel dread for the new season coming, I am able to better serve my community, and I can face each day knowing I am guarded from the attacks of the enemy.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God does not want us to be burdened and weighed down by anxiety. Instead, He wants us to have a transformative relationship with Him that incorporates our gratitude and surrender to Him through prayer.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What anxieties can you hand over to God right now? Ask God to show you the places in your life that need His guarding and the places that need His peace.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank you for desiring to know what is on my heart and carry it as your burden. Thank you for protecting my heart and filling me with indescribable peace, especially in the moments that seem so dark and hopeless. I pray that you remind me every day to show you gratitude for the comfort you provide.</p>

  <p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">Written by: Dawn Haasnoot, Mary Hannah Dolan, and Hannah Gall&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But He said to them, “You give them something to eat.” They said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish.” Luke 9:13a</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This September, we (Dawn, Mary Hannah, and Hannah) set out with five other members of the Point to participate in medical missions in Togo. We didn’t really know what to expect, so we were prepared to do whatever the Lord called us to do. We were equipped with medicine, medical supplies, oral hygiene items, children’s toys, and anything else we could stuff into thirteen suitcases.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our first day of clinic was at a remote village located about two hours north of Lome, the country’s capital. In the village’s church building, we set up a triage area, provider stations, and a pharmacy, anticipating we would see around 200-300 patients. We were quickly overwhelmed by the needs of the people we saw: worms, malaria, wounds, hypertension were a few of the many conditions we diagnosed. By the end of the day, villagers crowded in from all entrances of the church made clinic, hoping to be seen and examined by the physicians. We questioned how we would be able to meet the needs of all of the people in this village as well as our next two days of clinic. Yet, at the end of the day, we were able to treat over 400 patients and had enough supplies and medicine left over for our other two clinic days.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On our final day in Togo, we were able to participate in a Vacation Bible School for the children of AKEM. As we were unsure of our role in the VBS prior to our arrival in Togo, we had not prepared sufficiently. However, the Lord took the little we had to offer to the children (a short Bible skit and song), and multiplied it; the rest of the afternoon, we saw kids joyfully repeating the hand motions we had taught them about the creation story. We were also able to gift each child a pair of their very own underwear. The joy they expressed after receiving such a simple gift is unforgettable to us. Over 1000 kids heard the message of the Gospel that day.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This week in Togo challenged us to rely on God’s provision. We frequently experienced having “no more than five loaves and two fish.” Like the disciples in Luke 9, we had to trust in God to meet the needs of the people we were serving. Though we often felt we didn’t have enough to give, we repeatedly saw the Lord provide for each need.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lord, thank you for being our Great Provider, Jehovah Jireh. Help us to rely on your promises, even when our circumstances seem overwhelming. Amen. &nbsp;</p>

      <title>How To Prepare for Battle</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/10/15/praying-a-miracle</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Make this your common practice: pray for each other so that you can live together whole and healed. The prayer of a person living right with God is something powerful to be reckoned with.”</em> <strong>James 5:16 (MSG)</strong><br> <br>The story of how my 23-year-old cousin Ben lived; it starts, in fact, five days before he died.&nbsp; His mom, my Aunt Barbara, woke up on a Sunday morning this past April with a strong feeling she should fast that morning and pray instead of eating breakfast.&nbsp; And on Monday morning, she felt the same way.&nbsp; This feeling continued for four days, resulting in a water or black-tea-only fast until 10:30 each morning, at which point she would allow herself coffee with milk and food for breakfast.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On the fifth day, as Aunt Barbara was fasting, my cousin Ben was on a short morning jog about 30 minutes away, when his heart stopped, and he collapsed on the pavement.&nbsp; His jogging route had taken him through future housing developments that were paused in their construction, where his body would have probably not been discovered for who knows who long, but thankfully when he collapsed he was in his neighborhood, and thankfully in the vicinity of a neighbor who found him on the sidewalk a few minutes later.&nbsp; This neighbor just so happened to work in the hospital emergency room and was able to provide high quality CPR until the ambulance arrived, which it thankfully did shortly.&nbsp; The medics were able to find a pulse after administering the fifth shock.&nbsp; Upon arrival to the hospital, Ben’s girlfriend was a nurse working in the emergency department and thankfully was able to identify Ben as well as his medical history and current medications and dosages.&nbsp; Despite the rain for which April is well known, the weather conditions were good enough for the helicopter to immediately transport him to Johns Hopkins, which somehow had a vacant bed in their small cardiac critical care unit staffed with doctors who happened to be well versed in Ben’s exact condition.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">By the time Aunt Barbara broke her fast that day, God had already worked miracles beyond anyone’s wildest expectations.&nbsp; Ben’s heart had stopped for 13 minutes, and by the grace of God it was miraculously working hard to beat again.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">More miracles were needed for his body to recover from those 13 minutes, though.&nbsp; The doctors at Johns Hopkins at first were hesitant he would survive.&nbsp; After a day they were confident he would live but were hesitant about whether or not he would be brain dead for the rest of his life, or if he could breathe on his own or have functioning kidneys ever again. After another day they were confident he had some brain function but were hesitant about how much and how long it would take to get back to a semblance of quality of life.&nbsp; After another day, they realized he had good brain function and would likely be able to leave the hospital within a year. The doctors reasoned that if things continued to progress, he would be stable enough for heart surgery within a few months.&nbsp; The rate of his healing was so fast that he had surgery within a few days.&nbsp; Ben’s healing confounded and mystified everyone as he walked out of the hospital one week after his body was found on the sidewalk.&nbsp; There was no residual damage to any of his organs and no recommendations for any rehabilitation therapy.&nbsp; He was healed.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ben’s miraculous healing was inexplicable from a medical perspective, but not from a spiritual one.&nbsp; I witnessed spiritual battle in Aunt Barbara like I had never seen anywhere else. I saw how she laid hands on Ben, fully prepared to go to war with the Enemy as she prayed dozens upon dozens of memorized Scripture verses over Ben’s body.&nbsp; I watched how she declared victory over his circumstances.&nbsp; I saw how she surrendered everything over to God, so that when Ben’s older sister arrived with a deep respiratory cough the third day he was at Johns Hopkins, Aunt Barbara didn’t&nbsp; flinch about letting his sister by his bedside because she knew something as trivial as a cough was no match for the healing being done through Jesus.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The number of prayers being prayed over Ben would be an interesting exercise to attempt to calculate.&nbsp; At his bedside with not much else to talk about, his siblings and I tried to figure it out at one point and reached around 1,500 people that we estimated we knew firsthand were praying for him.&nbsp; That can’t possibly take into account the ripple effects of people we didn’t even know who had heard about Ben’s condition and felt called to pray.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Witnessing Ben’s miracle changed my life in so many ways, but for the sake of brevity for this blog post I’ll just say my biggest takeaway was that we have been given the blueprint for how to fight and win spiritual battles if we prepare ourselves and open our hearts to the Holy&nbsp;Spirit.&nbsp; We never know when or how the Enemy will strike, but we do know there is a faithful God who can defeat the Enemy on our behalf if we are willing and able to call upon Him.&nbsp; Aunt Barbara couldn’t have known what she would be up against that fifth morning she woke up and felt called to fast, but thanks to her willingness to obey God and a lifetime spent memorizing Scripture and developing a trust in God’s Word, she was prepared to fight a battle.&nbsp; And God was so faithful as a result, showing again and again how mighty He is.&nbsp; As Aunt Barbara put it afterwards, God is the same yesterday, today and forever.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Thank you God, for showing us that miracles happen every day and giving us the tools to fight our battles. Thank you for your steadfastness.&nbsp;Help us to trust your plan for our lives and spread the good news of your power and love.</em></p>

      <title>Value</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/10/22/value</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Value</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“For you know that God paid a ransom to save you from the empty life you inherited from your ancestors. And it was not paid with mere gold or silver, which lose their value. It was the precious blood of Christ, the sinless, spotless Lamb of God.”</em> (1 Peter 1:18-19 NLT)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Performance, possessions, and popularity – Does that sound like a miserable flashback to high school or what? If only that trio faded into ancient history like SAT scores. It seems though we have a natural tendency to believe these equate our value far into adulthood.&nbsp; Even Jesus was tempted to prove himself in these key areas.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As we read the temptation of Jesus, we see he was first taunted to <em>“command these stones to become loaves of bread.”</em> (Matthew 4:3) Satan was prodding Jesus to prove himself. Ring a bell? Years ago, I met a famous preacher and the first thing she said to me was, “What do you do?” I don’t know why she asked that question. Perhaps, she was trying to make a connection, but her words twisted in my mind to imply that what I do equates my value. Thankfully, the Bible clearly states the tremendous value God gives every human life regardless of performance, including yours. Like Jesus, your worth is not rooted in your performance but God’s perspective of you.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Satan then offered Jesus <em>“all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.” </em>(Matt. 4:8) Evil still encourages the old lie that we are what we have. Ultimately, it’s a security issue. If we identify ourselves by any means other than the Word of God -our education, the size of our home, our position at work, our spouse, if we compare ourselves to others- we are using the inferior measuring stick of this world. Jesus refused culture’s definition of success and instead allowed his success to be defined by obedience to God. He was secure in knowing His Father and his inheritance as God’s child.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The pull of self-glorification also dangled before Jesus (v8). If Jesus received the enemy’s gift and worshipped him, he would not be reviled by people or nailed to a cross. Instead, all would have a good opinion of him resulting in immense praise and honor. As Satan offered the kingdoms of the world to Jesus, he was suggesting Jesus could bypass God’s plan and grab his glory ahead of time. We fight this temptation too, for instance, whenever we plan a response in conversation to positively shape what others think of us, or with a social media post where our self-image is bolstered with likes. Parents face glorifying themselves concerning their child’s abilities or where their student attends college. We must remember we are who God says we are, not what others think of us.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we become enamored with performance, possessions, and popularity we are believing they add more value to our lives than what God has already declared. Today, live like Jesus – in the light of God’s deep affection, receiving the worth and value He has already placed on you, His beloved child.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Reflection:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Do you know what God thinks of you? Google search, “What does God think of me?” You’ll find many resources pointing to scripture that express God’s thoughts toward you.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You for setting Your love on me. Forgive me for seeking worth in anything outside of You. Please fill me with the light of Your truth and draw me deeper into Your love that I may know my true worth and value. &nbsp;</p>

      <title>Developing Patience</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Psalm 37:3-7a</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Each year I select a word to be my focus and help me to grow in my faith.&nbsp; Along with that word I search the scriptures to find a verse that speaks to my heart about the growth I sense God wants for me.&nbsp; This year, I felt God was directing me to a word that most people are leery of asking for – patience.&nbsp; To paraphrase an old saying:&nbsp; If you pray for patience, God will present you with trials to give you an opportunity to develop patience.&nbsp; And this year He has done just that.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As I searched the scriptures for the right verses to memorize and focus on, God lead me to Psalm 37, where He lays out a “formula” if you will with four steps to develop a heart and mind of patience. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Step 1: Trust God:</span>&nbsp; <em>“Trust in the Lord, and do good; dwell in the land and befriend faithfulness.” v.3</em>&nbsp; Our first step is to trust in God and seek to do His will – to be good and faithful in the place that He has us, knowing He will never leave or forsake us.&nbsp; So we ask ourselves – Am I willing to truly trust that God has my best interest?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Step 2: Delight in God:</span>&nbsp; <em>“Delight yourself in the LORD, and he will give you the desires of your heart.” v.4</em> When we know the Lord and delight in having fellowship with Him – reading His Word and being in a mindset of prayer – His heart’s desires become ours and we can rejoice in knowing and walking with our Lord. Question – What or whom do I delight in?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Step 3: Commit to God’s Ways:</span>&nbsp; <em>“Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him, and he will act. He will bring forth your righteousness as the light, and your justice as the noonday.” v.5-6</em> God’s ways – His commands – are good and trustworthy.&nbsp; He takes action and directs our paths to make all things new and good for those that love Him and are committed to Him.&nbsp; Question - Am I committed to God’s plan and not my own?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Step 4: Be Still:</span>&nbsp; <em>“Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him.” v.7a</em> When we trust, delight and commit to the Lord, we can find rest and enjoy God’s goodness.&nbsp; When we truly do this, we can be patient and wait for God’s plan, in His perfect timing and for His glory, to be fulfilled.&nbsp; Question – Am I willing to be still before God?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer:&nbsp; Lord, I love you and want to be completely in your will with whatever situation you bring into my life.&nbsp; My desire is to trust you more.&nbsp; To truly delight in what you are doing in my life.&nbsp; To be fully committed to your ways.&nbsp; Thank you Lord for your desire to continually shape me more into your image; to be more Christ-like.&nbsp; May my heart, mind and soul be still before you as I wait patiently for your plan to unfold.&nbsp; In Jesus’ name. Amen.</p>

      <title>God’s Kindness in Refinement</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/11/12/gods-kindness-in-refinement</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.” – Ephesians 3:20 (TPT)</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we experience seasons of loss, financial burden, uncertainty or waiting, we may feel that God is more of a foe than a friend. Is God who He says He is? Or is He the God of the circumstances that I am experiencing?&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I recently walked through a season where I questioned just that - ‘Is God always kind to me?’ I had a clear vision about what the next phase of my life should look like, but God didn’t reveal the fruit I was hoping for. My lens became focused on this direction, while God kept nudging me down a different path. In the fall of 2018, I joined The Point’s prayer group, which quickly became one of the biggest blessings of my life. While I continued to ask God to change my circumstance, He slowly but surely changed me.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Through individual and group prayer, He refined in me what it looks like to listen and walk with Him daily. I realized that there were so many areas where God was presenting manna where I never thought He would have. Multigenerational friendships, new service opportunities, a mission trip to Cuba– but most importantly, a deepened trust in Him to “do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us” (NIV 3:20). God gave me a genuine assurance in my soul to always be my Savior, my Advocate and my Provider. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Paul wrote the letter to the Ephesians while he underwent imprisonment in Rome. His letter is filled with joyful truth, encouragement and unwavering faith despite his circumstance. What an incredible example of resting in God’s faithfulness! Instead of immediately filling the empty places in my heart with what I desired, God allowed the empty places to be seen. And that is one of the most kind and loving things He could ever do.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, I am thankful that You are always kind and know what we need. Help us to constantly fix our eyes on You. Remove any fear or doubt in our hearts and replace it with a steadfast understanding that Your ways are always good. Help us to lock Your truth and the gift of salvation in our hearts, regardless of our circumstance. In Jesus’ name, Amen.&nbsp;</p>

      <title>Being Built Together</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/11/25/being-built-together</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God's people and also members of his household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit. (Ephesians 2:19-22 NIV)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This past October nine men went on a mission trip to San Pedro, Mexico. We partnered with Advancing Native Missions and built a two-story building in place of a 40-year-old structure that needed to be demolished and removed. This new building will house the children’s church and be a center to train missionaries that will spread the gospel of Jesus Christ throughout Central America. Beyond the building of this physical structure, we saw God moving to build us all individually and together in many powerful ways.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our group was able to share our testimonies daily within a soccer program that is bringing the gospel of Jesus Christ to young men. Many of them have been impacted by the drug cartels, which have a large presence throughout this region of Mexico. We have been told that since we left, three of these young men chose to accept Jesus Christ as Lord and were baptized!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We saw so many examples of men reaching out, being vulnerable and receiving love and prayer. One man, Tomas, overheard a testimony and approached us. He shared that he was a recovering alcoholic that lost a brother to the cartels, was struggling with anxiety and needed prayer. God worked with us to build him up with prayer and encouragement.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Another young man David had divisions within his family and the family that his sister married into. He wanted to help us build but told us he was not interested in church. We worked side by side with David and later in the week he attended a church service. We also witnessed firsthand the unification with his new brother-in-law and his family. They went from trying to stop the wedding to preparing food together and serving it to us!&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Another man Jonathon and his wife asked for prayer after a youth service. Two other men shared of personal needs after a men’s evening fellowship. God was working to edify this community as we shared His love, His Word and sought Him through prayer. The legacy of this experience is in a building we built but more importantly in the building up of the community and the growth that we each personally experienced as we served.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, I ask that You work in us to will and do of Your good pleasure. Help build us up as we work to build others up around us. May we have a heart of service. Fill us all to overflowing that we may be able to give and grow and love and serve Your people more and more, in the name of Jesus Christ.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p>

      <title>Regarding Gratitude</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/11/5/regarding-gratitude</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Zephaniah 3:17 <em>“The LORD your God is among you; He is mighty to save. He will rejoice over you with gladness; He will quiet you with His love; He will rejoice over you with singing.”</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">WOW.&nbsp; God SINGS over us with JOY?&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">GRATITUDE is in all 66 books of the Bible, and it’s an almost overwhelming exercise in joy to study it!&nbsp; Gratitude includes awe; praise; thankfulness; glory, joy, wonder, worship, exultation.&nbsp; God made us in His Image, and we are hard-wired for gratitude just like we are hard-wired for worship; it is in our spiritual DNA.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Reading through the Bible… through all the troubles, sins, wars, and heartaches; EVEN SO, there is a golden thread from Genesis to Revelation, running through the whole sacred cloth!&nbsp; ANYTHING repeated in so many different iterations, deserves attention. It greatly matters to God.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Gratitude shows up in Genesis 2:23, when Adam first saw Eve. If you dig into the original Hebrew and nuances, this short simple poem explodes with joy!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Judges, Job and Lamentations are perhaps the saddest books, but gratitude exists.&nbsp; Ecclesiastes is SO somber, but still gratitude!&nbsp; And Jude — that very dour, penultimate book — has it… Extremely tough times often cause extreme praise. Some of the most grateful books of the Bible are Psalms, Proverbs, Isaiah, and Jeremiah (“the weeping prophet”).&nbsp; In the midst of all of the troubles in these books, the golden thread of gratitude runs through it all.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Hosea, Amos and Obadiah are notable for their <span style="text-decoration:underline">LACK</span> of gratitude, and God makes a very big deal about it…</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Gospels and the NT letters are overflowing with living waters of love and praise.&nbsp; In fact, Philippians is “the happiest book of the Bible”, and Paul wrote it in <span style="text-decoration:underline">JAIL</span>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The final book — Revelation: Glory, praise and ineffable joy are all over it, as God fulfills every promise starting in Genesis, and makes everything right!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So, what does that have to do with you and me, right now?&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration:underline">Everything.</span>&nbsp; Every generation has all the ups-and-downs of life.&nbsp; GRATITUDE is a particular type of ATTITUDE, and that can flow out of us in ANY situation, through the rivers of living water of the Holy Spirit; any time we choose, despite circumstances.&nbsp; GRATITUDE is RADICAL, COUNTERINTUITIVE, COUNTERCULTURAL, OVERWHELMING, and ALWAYS AVAILABLE.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We have the Word of God, from Genesis to Revelation, to assure us of this:</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">That after satan, the world and our own flesh have done everything that they are allowed to do…</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">After I have wrecked my life,</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">and maybe you have wrecked your life more than once</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">in every possible permutation</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">and just plain boneheaded scheme and idea;</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">after we have done our worst and called it our best:</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">It’s like God says, <span style="text-decoration:underline">“You done yet?</span></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>MY</strong></span> turn.”</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">God says, "I will write the final Word on your life.</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">They've taken their best shot, and now it's MY TURN.</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">I will write the final Word on the final page in your life.</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><span style="text-decoration:underline">I AM the final Word on the final page of your life.”</span></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And THAT is worth all my praise, for all eternity.&nbsp; There are a quintillion other reasons for gratitude, but that one RIGHT THERE is <span style="text-decoration:underline">everything.</span>&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father, if You never did another thing for me, I would never be able to thank You enough for all that You have already done. And Father, it’s not that my life is that great. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Except it is.</span> It’s my little life, and it’s a <span style="text-decoration:underline">great</span> life! (Because everyone has a great life, <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>IF</strong></span> they have You.) There are things I don’t have, but oh what I have… And I’m nobody special. Every one of us has a great life if we can see it through Your Eyes. If we have You, even on our worst days, we have EVERYTHING.&nbsp; And that is beyond anything I could possibly deserve or comprehend. Thank You forever for loving me, before I even knew You.</p>

      <title>Looking for Joy</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">Scripture: Joy is gone from our hearts; our dancing has turned to mourning. Lamentations 5:15</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br>Is it really that bad? She was old. She lived a long life. She loved me. She didn’t suffer. She was only sick for 17 days.&nbsp; All of those things make logical sense and yet I am still mourning. My 91-year-old mother passed away this past March after a 17 day illness. I always thought that if someone was old then it wasn’t a big deal to lose them. I have learned that it doesn’t work that way. Loss is loss. As I face this first Christmas without my mom and see how challenging it is, I am newly aware of all of the people I know who have lost loved ones in the past. Was I kind and considerate during their “firsts” for the next year or two? I am ashamed to say I don’t know that I was. I want to do better. I want to open my eyes and be considerate of anyone who is alone or facing challenges.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is so much to be thankful for in remembering my mom. She truly did live a long life. She was blessed to only suffer a few weeks.&nbsp; This isn’t everyone’s story. They may lose someone tragically in an instant or suffer with them for years before it is finally over. The Lord uses every challenge in my life and gives me the opportunity to grow better or to become bitter. There are few guarantees in life, but one is for certain, we will all experience loss. I don’t want to go through this season with a sad face and a heavy heart. My mother loved Christmas! I know that she would want me to carry on and continue to enjoy my life. I pray that I will open my eyes and see those who are going through a hard time. I want to be used by the Lord to offer a listening ear or do something with them or for them that will bring them joy. I am grateful for the legacy my mother left of caring and giving.&nbsp;</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer: </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lord, open my eyes to those who are hurting around me. Help me to show compassion and love. Thank you for the gift of Jesus. In Jesus name. Amen.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p>

      <title>Spirit-filled hearts in Cuba</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">“And the disciples were continually filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.” Acts 13:52</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">By Dana Mares<br></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God had been prompting me to go on a mission trip and when the opportunity came to go on an all-women trip to Cuba I knew that was the trip I was supposed to take.&nbsp; I did not know what to expect, but I had a sense of anticipation for what God was going to do.&nbsp; Of course, I&nbsp;had fears and anxieties as well but as I boarded our flight there was an overwhelming sense of God’s presence.&nbsp; I was not alone, not just because there were also 10 fabulous women going along but because the Holy Spirit was right there with me.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our time in Cuba was divided between serving in the local church and community and a women’s conference at a camp outside of Havana.&nbsp; The theme for the conference was the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; As a team we had been praying for months that God’s Spirit would show up in a mighty way during this time and wow… did He ever!&nbsp; Through solid Biblical teaching we were challenged to go deeper in our walk with the Lord, to live in the overflow of the Spirit and not by our own efforts.&nbsp; We saw God bring freedom and hope to many women as we shared personal testimonies.&nbsp; We “raised an alleluia” in Spanish and English at the same time and reflected the glory of the Lord in the unity of believers.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">“For the Lord is the Spirit, and wherever the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&nbsp; So all of us who have had that veil removed can see and reflect the glory of the Lord.&nbsp; And the Lord – who is the Spirit- makes us more and more like Him as we are changed into His glorious image.”&nbsp; 2 Corinthians 3:17-18 (NLT)</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In Cuba we found amazing beautiful people with hearts hungry for more of God.&nbsp;We found that worship has no language barriers.&nbsp; We found a passion for the Lord that both inspired and challenged us.&nbsp; We found that women have the same hurts and life experiences all over the world and that God is moving to bring healing and hope.&nbsp; We found that prayer is a universal language.&nbsp; And we found sisters in Christ that will forever be in our hearts.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection:</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">These words from the conference theme song still play in my mind: “Holy Spirit You are welcome here”...&nbsp; As the owner of a Bed &amp; Breakfast I understand the importance of being a welcoming host. I put out the best china and linens and I spend hours baking and preparing for my guests.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because I want them to feel welcomed. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How often do we put the same kind of effort into welcoming the Spirit to work in our lives?&nbsp; Have we prepared our hearts?&nbsp; Do we spend enough time in God’s Word and in prayer?&nbsp; Are we thirsty for God?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Spirit-filled hearts don’t just happen, they come from an overflow of the Holy Spirit working in our lives as we seek Him daily.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer:</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lord, we pray for more of Your Spirit in our lives.&nbsp; We pray as David prayed in Psalm 63:1, “O God, you are my God; I earnestly search for you.&nbsp; My soul thirsts for you; my whole body longs for you in this parched and weary land where there is no water.” Thank you that when we seek you, You allow yourself to be found.&nbsp; Thank you that You are in the process of continually making us more like You.&nbsp; Help us to be ever mindful of the Spirit’s presence in our lives.&nbsp; We love You Lord.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

      <title>Getting Past the Words</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/2/11/getting-past-the-words</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My familiarity with prayer as a child was limited to something we recited at dinner, something we heard at church, what you did when someone was sick, and the closing activity before bedtime. As I got older, there were a few times that I found myself falling to my knees, my face bowed to the floor, coming to God - and I remember them vividly. Each time was out of desperation. I don’t remember the words, but the feeling of connection to my Father- <em>that</em> stuck with me.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Over time, I’ve realized that it’s never been the words that mattered to God. God is not concerned with how articulate we are, he’s concerned with our hearts. And the reason those desperate fall-to-my-knees moments are so etched in my heart are because they were turning points in my relationship with Him-- from knowing <em>about </em>Him to <em>knowing </em>Him.<em>&nbsp;</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As Jesus sends out his disciples, preparing them for persecution in spreading the Gospel, he says, “do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say, for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour. For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Holy Spirit is powerful enough to know our prayers, our needs and the desires of our hearts, before we say a word, but the act of just coming humbly before God is what honors Him. &nbsp;He desires our prayers because he desires relationship - it’s not a one way street.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer isn’t about knowing all the answers. It’s about having communion with the one who does.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In Colossians 4:2, Paul reminds the people to “Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful.” To pray with an open heart is not being scared of “doing it right,” but to connect with our creator and allow Him space to be King of our lives in every emotion and circumstance. Yes, the desperate times, but also in gratefulness, joy, creativity, and <em>noticing</em> His hand in it all.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>A few things that help me when I don’t know what or how to pray :&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Reading scripture - I read a passage and pull out one verse that moves me, focusing on each word or phrase of it and praying from the overflow&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Worship music - When I’m studying a song for Sunday mornings or just listening in my own time, sometimes I’ll rest on a particular lyric and pray over it. Saying a verse or lyric over and over again anchors something in my heart and I begin to pray from that truth.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Community - Building relationship with other believers who pray openly and boldly for one another has helped me see not only the power of prayer, but confidence in doing it, and given me new language to pray for issues or emotions.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer:&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father, we praise you for knowing, understanding, and loving us even when we don’t have the words to express it. Help us to continue seeking you, that we would grow in relationship with you daily and hear your voice in new and powerful ways.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p>

      <title>Giving Fresh Meaning to the Lord’s Prayer</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/2/11/giving-fresh-meaning-to-the-lords-prayer</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father in secret. &nbsp;And your father who sees in secret will reward you. And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words. &nbsp;Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.”</em> Matthew 6:5-8</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Giving Fresh Meaning to the Lord’s Prayer</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Before I knew the Lord, I was fascinated by the ritual of church: the hymns, the recited refrains, the scripture references in bold in my bulletin, the doxology, and the Lord’s prayer. &nbsp;When I was very young, I would watch churchgoers lift their eyes from their bibles when the pastor asked them to begin reciting the Lord’s prayer - in the King James, of course! My eyes would scour the bulletin, looking for the words the congregation knew by heart. &nbsp;It felt like I was left out of a special club because I couldn’t utter those words from memory, that my lack of “spirituality” would be like the words <em>faker</em> or <em>interloper</em> painted on my forehead. &nbsp;It wasn’t until much later, when I finally heard a message about what the Lord’s prayer actually means, did these verses really capture my heart. &nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Lord’s prayer is a guide to some of the most powerful, authentic prayer I’ve ever uttered:</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. &nbsp;Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” &nbsp;</em>God, you’re awesome. &nbsp;You are holy, righteous, and so good. &nbsp;You know much better than me, so please do what you want here on earth.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Give us this day our daily bread.” </em>Lord, you are my provider. &nbsp;You know me, my heart, and every thought that crosses my brain. &nbsp;You know the things I think I need. But Lord, I ask you now to provide me with my actual needs. &nbsp;The things I need to keep following you.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.” &nbsp;</em>Phew. This is a big one. &nbsp;Lord, forgive me. Forgive me for the unkind thoughts I had about that lady at the grocery store. &nbsp;Forgive me for the words I spoke in anger to my daughter. Forgive me for the patterns of thinking that keep me prisoner to sin. &nbsp;Forgive me for not trusting you. Forgive me for not following you as you have commanded. <em>&nbsp;</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.” &nbsp;</em>Father, protect me from my enemy, who lives, for when I’m weak, vulnerable, distracted, and powerless. &nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.” &nbsp;</em>All of these things I ask, Lord, because You deserve my very best. &nbsp;You are worthy of my very best.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus gave us this prayer to combat artificial spirituality, to help us avoid empty phrases, to help us find words when we’re so broken we can’t find the words for ourselves. &nbsp;I know that I’m so grateful to have a reminder of what to say when the right words are hard to find.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer: </strong>Lord, let my prayers, even when I don’t have the smartest, most spiritual words, be sweet to your ears. &nbsp;Help me grow in my relationship with You through these words, authentic words uttered in private.&nbsp;</p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles. All the believers were together and had everything in common. Selling their possessions and goods they gave to anyone as they had need. Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.”</em> (Acts 2:42-47 NIV)</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">April and I began attending community group 18 years ago at a large church in Minnesota. Our desire was to meet people and build new friendships. God taught us that it is much more than just meeting people and there is great value to biblical fellowship. It is a great place to make friends, learn more about Christ and live life with other believers. Group is a place where you can walk through tough trials and people will rally around you. It’s a place where people will listen and pray for the things going on in your life. It is also a place to grow in humility, to serve others, and to love one another as we are called. &nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One of our favorite ways to fellowship at group is by gathering around a table to share a meal. People relax and use the time to share about their family, hobbies, jobs, and other personal details. While breaking bread there is often laughter and time for telling stories. It allows everyone to get to know one another on a very personal level.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">While discussing God’s word the relationships that are being built grow even deeper. When the Bible is at the center of the discussion, we gain the knowledge of God’s word. It is our source of encouragement or correction in those moments. Sharing experiences and examples of what God has taught or revealed to others, has helped us grow in applying those truths to our own lives.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In a world that is so far from God and people are feeling disconnected, groups provide a place where we can link arms, put our shields together and boldly go forward spreading the gospel. Groups allow us to encourage one another through the ups and downs of life. When one of the members needs help the group acts as a family. We have experienced this first hand through meals delivered to our family, prayers, watching our children, support through several deaths within our family, celebrating the births of both our children, and strong arms during several moves.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for the gift of fellowship within groups. It is our prayer that everyone who attends The Point will join a group and experience your love through their church family. In Jesus’ name; amen</p>

      <title>In Everything - Pray</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/2/4/in-everything-pray</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” (<a href="https://ebible.com/query?utf=8%25E2%259C%2593&amp;query=Philippians%25204%253A6-7&amp;translation=ESV&amp;redirect_iframe=https://www.allaboutprayer.org/bible.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>).</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;“Be joyful always; pray continually; give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.” (<a href="https://ebible.com/query?utf=8%25E2%259C%2593&amp;query=1%2520Thessalonians%25205%253A16-18&amp;translation=ESV&amp;redirect_iframe=https://www.allaboutprayer.org/bible.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:16-18</a>).&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How simple these verses make it sound to constantly be praying and giving thanks, yet how often do we feel like the world is crashing around us and we have nowhere to turn.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What does it even mean to pray&nbsp;<em>continually,&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>without ceasing</em>? Try thinking of it like keeping the line of communication open with God at all times. We might not be able to be on our knees in prayer 24-7-365, but we can keep our heart and mind open to hearing God in everything we do. We can also seek him first in our everyday decisions rather than last.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>&nbsp;</em>Too often prayer becomes an afterthought, an option, or a last minute lifeline when we feel like everything else hasn’t worked. The Bible tell us that prayer is the opposite of these things. If we choose to put communication with God first and in everything we do, HIS PEACE will guard us. Wow, that sound like a much better option than trying to solve our problems, get frustrated, and then eventually turn to prayer.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>PRAYER TIPS:</strong></p><ol data-rte-list="default" style="margin-left:40px;"><li><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Start everyday by giving thanks for all you have.</p></li><li><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ask God to speak to you throughout the day and keep the line of communication open with Him.</p></li><li><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Commit to seeking him first in everything you do.</p></li></ol><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>PRAYER:</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear God,</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Thank you for all you have done in my life. Help me to seek you continually and in everything I do. I ask that your peace will guard my heart and mind as I commit to keeping the line of communication up with you throughout the day.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">-Trevor and Kelly Gach</p>

      <title>Just Hold A Baby?</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Verse</strong>:&nbsp; <em>Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might. </em><strong>Ecc. 9:10a</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	As a mother of only one child – a daughter who has no children of her own – I confess to having an occasional case of “Grandma Envy”!&nbsp; I have often longed to have a little one of my own to hold, kiss, care for and love, and have sometimes jealously watched my friends doting on their precious grandchildren, spending time with them, and talking enthusiastically about them as they share their photographs and stories.&nbsp; While I can rejoice in their happiness and blessings, my own desires and disappointments are still there, lurking just beneath the surface of my emotions.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	Shortly after joining The Point, I remember vividly that one Sunday Pastor Gabe brought out a large fishing net onto the stage and invited several Point volunteers to come out and hold the net with him.&nbsp; He encouraged each of us in the congregation to “Get your hands on the net” and find the right place to volunteer.&nbsp; He mentioned several areas where there were needs, and began commending those who served in each area.&nbsp; He ended his list of compliments with “And they’re rockin’ it out in Kids Point!”&nbsp; I was thinking at the time that I would like to find some type of administrative or office work – something I was used to doing during the week at my job, and something I would enjoy.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	A year or so went by, and again one Sunday morning Pastor Gabe made an appeal for volunteers.&nbsp; He discussed several opportunities, emphasizing that each one was important.&nbsp; He said, “Even if you just hold a baby,” God can use you.&nbsp; The Holy Spirit immediately tapped me on the shoulder, reminding me of my longing to have grandchildren in my life, and suggesting that Kids Point might just be the answer.&nbsp; It was exciting to think that on Sunday mornings I could actually take care of, play with, and hold babies – what fun for a wannabe grandmother like me!</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	God’s wisdom never ceases to amaze me.&nbsp; I loved it, and before long I, too, was “rockin’ it out in Kids Point” with my precious little ones.&nbsp; The ministry there is, of course, to provide these infants with a safe and nurturing environment, meeting their needs, and keeping them entertained, fed, changed, and hopefully happy.&nbsp; But the parents of the children are also blessed.&nbsp; It is because of the Kids Point volunteers they know they can attend the church service and focus on worshipping God without worry or distraction. &nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	But for me, I’m the one who receives the greatest blessing of all just to have these children in my life on Sunday mornings.&nbsp; For an hour or so I’m needed, my arms are filled, my spirit is delighted, and my heart is warmed and satisfied.&nbsp; While I’m busy providing for the needs of others, the Lord is graciously meeting my own needs with love and joy.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	Jesus spoke these words in <strong>Matt. 25:40</strong>, <em>“Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.”</em>&nbsp; Perhaps you are currently volunteering at The Point and feeling somewhat discouraged about the value of your contribution.&nbsp; Please know that everything you do is needed and appreciated.&nbsp; Every effort you make is pleasing to God.&nbsp; And if someone asks you about your ministry, please don’t say, “I just direct traffic,” or “I just pour coffee,” or I just tear down, or “I just hold a baby.”&nbsp; What you do is much more than that – so much more!</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong>:&nbsp; <em>“O Lord, I thank you for placing me in a church where I am taught, nurtured, and inspired - a church where I am invited and encouraged to minister.&nbsp; May everything I do, no matter what it might be, bring glory to your name and serve you, as well as my fellow believers.&nbsp; I ask you to open my eyes to see the needs of others around me each day, and give me a servant’s heart that is filled with humility and compassion.&nbsp; In Jesus’ name, Amen.”</em></p>

      <title>Love Without Borders</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/3/19/love-without-borders</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reading</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear friends, let us love one another, for loves comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.&nbsp; <strong>1 John 4:7-8. (NIV)</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Love</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This past January my team and I spent ten days serving the Aeta people of the Philippines. The Aeta are thought to be one of the earliest, if not the first, inhabitants of the Philippines living primarily in isolated, and mountainous regions of the island of Luzon. Despite their long history, the Aeta have faced devastating social and economic marginalization and displacement. During our time, we traveled to a village and spent three days building a church and living alongside the Aeta ministering, serving and “doing life” with them. After our extended time in this village we traveled to two other remote villages and were able to worship and feed more of the Aeta people. We concluded our trip by spending a few days on campus with our ministry partner the Aeta Bible Study Center (ABSC). ABSC’s mission is to educate upcoming generations of Aeta children, with the gospel at the cornerstone of their education. ABSC also trains pastors and plants churches in remote villages to further spread the good news of Jesus Christ across the Philippines.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">During our time, love was resonating throughout the Filipino mountainside. Two groups of people from opposite sides of the world doing life together and loving on each other every step of the way. We ate together, we worked together, we laughed together, we cried together, we worshiped together. The Great Commandment (Mark 12:29-31) and the Great Commission (Matt 28:19-20) walked hand-in-hand.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1 John 4:7 first commands us to love. We must understand though that we do not love to <em>gain</em> His love but rather we love each other <em>because</em> He loves us. If we are truly born-again, we must be able to love one another. If verse 7 was not powerful enough, verse 8 should come as the ultimate reality check. If we cannot love, do we truly know God? Our knowledge and understanding of Him is manifested into our love for others. We cannot love without God because “God is love.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We can use 1 John 4:7-8 to think of love as electricity. We are powered by God’s love flowing to us. That same power then flows out of us into the world around us. The circuit is then complete when that power is used to draw others closer to God. When the circuit loses power or the current weakens, then we know that we need to lean in deeper and closer to Him. Verse 17 of the same chapter goes on to read, “This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgement: In this world we are like Jesus.” If we are going to claim to be followers of God then His love must flow freely from within us.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father, thank you for your love for me. May I constantly be reminded of your steadfast love. I want to be a shining example of your unconditional love to all those around me. I want to live in such a way that those who do not know you but know me will come to know you because they know me. And may I be an encouragement to those who already know you and help strengthen their relationship with you. Amen.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

      <title>A Heart For Serving</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/3/26/a-heart-for-serving</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1 Samuel 12:24</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“But be sure to fear the Lord and serve him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things he has done for you”.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We are called to serve. There is no way to debate that statement. In some way, shape or form, we are to serve in the ways that the Lord created us. I have been attending The Point for about three years when I took a bold step out of my comfort zone and said, “Here I am, Lord. Use me to serve you.” That was the breakthrough moment when I felt at home and experienced the fullness of Christ. I felt like I was thriving. I was not thriving because of anything I did, but rather what the Lord did through me. He clearly showed me how I needed to serve when I made that step of obedience.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Serving starts with the right mindset. One thing that I have learned during my time serving is the more I operate with the mindset of <em>everything I do is serving the Lord</em>, the more I find a complete and whole joy within myself and what I do. There have been times when I have had unenthusiastic thoughts about serving, but I am able to instantly discern that I am not operating with the mindset of Christ and in turn, change how I think.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After you have developed a Christ-centered mindset, you can then move on to finding and or using the gifts you have been blessed with in a service capacity. The wonderful thing is we are called to different things! We do not have to be good at everything to serve Him. Although there are many different ways to build up the body of Christ, serving others is so powerful because it allows us to physically see with our eyes the effect that it has on people. Serving is a reflection of Jesus’ love and in order to build up the body of Christ it is imperative that we love through serving one another.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lastly, when the Lord births a calling in your heart, use it. If you think about it but never put it into action, then it is useless. The most genuine way to serve God on earth is to serve others.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Think about a time in your life when someone served you. How did that make you feel? I encourage you to take the time to pray and seek out people in your life that you can serve.&nbsp; Pray about how God wants to use you to serve Him for your good and His glory. Pray boldly. He will answer in amazing ways.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear Lord, thank You so much for the spiritual gifts You have given to each of us. We ask that You give us the courage and the faith to use our gifts to serve You with an undivided heart. Lord, we ask that You help us not to be self seeking but to truly birth in us the unshakable desire to serve You for Your glory. We want to add to Your joy, Lord. We love You. Amen.&nbsp;</p>

      <title>Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/3/26/yesterday-today-and-tomorrow</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading:<em> “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today and forever.” </em>-Hebrews 13:8</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Over 60 people from The Point took a trip to Israel last month and my family was fortunate enough to be a part of it. This trip did many things for my faith, but the single greatest was how it opened my eyes that the land we read about in the Bible was not a fantasy or mythological Narnia but is a legit place. My eyes were opened that the Bible shows us the past, impacts my faith today and taught me what’s going to happen tomorrow.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Yesterday:</strong> I’ve read the Bible since I was in preschool, but I always thought of it as a story and not a real, physical place. In Israel, I got to stand next to a tree in the Garden of Gethsemane that was older than our country. It’s amazing to walk the path that Jesus used on the way to be crucified and think about the markets all around and people in the street watching. This was not how I pictured it or saw it in Veggie Tales cartoons as a kid. In Cesarea, standing where Paul was imprisoned and defended himself and seeing the surroundings taught me that Paul probably heard chariot races happening above his prison cell and this made the story come to life. The trip to Israel was like time traveling through the Bible and it opened my eyes to see the reality of the Word of God.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today:</strong> My eyes were opened to God’s love for me and my love for Him. One of my favorite parts of the trip was being baptized by Pastor Gabe in the Jordan River. Jesus got baptized in this very same place and it renewed my faith to have that experience. While the land is old, we worshiped and took communion the same way we do in Student Life and at the Point. One night, a couple dozen of us went out exploring the streets of Jerusalem. We came across a group of Korean tourists that were singing “How Great Thou Art” in their own language.&nbsp; We started singing the chorus in English while they continued in Korean. There were two languages singing the same hymn in a land neither one of us lived in. We stood together praising God. Being in the Holy Land showed me that being a Christian and worshiping Jesus looks the same everywhere you go.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Tomorrow: </strong>We often dream of what the future will look like. In Israel, it seemed more realistic when we stood where the book of Revelation tells us the gathering of armies for a battle during the end of times will happen. We saw the sealed Eastern Gate of Jerusalem’s old city wall and read about Jesus making his triumphal entry after he walks from the Mount of Olives. It opened my eyes to see the future and understand that the end of times is real, and we need to be prepared.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection: </strong>Think about your own faith. Many, many prophecies in the Bible have already been fulfilled. The things archeologist have found in Israel provide strength and evidence instead of just telling us to have faith. This gives us reason to have faith today and trust in tomorrow</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer:</strong> God, thank you for showing us evidence of your existence. Help us to love and worship you no matter where we are. Please let us trust you with whatever tomorrow holds.&nbsp;</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p>

  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Bear one another’s burdens.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Bear one another’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.”</em>&nbsp; Galatians 6:2</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>&nbsp;“We sent Timothy, who is our brother and co-worker in God’s service in spreading the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith.”</em>&nbsp; I Thessalonians 3:2</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So many of the “one another’s” of the Scripture like “bear one another’s burdens” are often lived out in small groups.&nbsp; This is the place where we really get to know each other.&nbsp; We are part of a growing, vibrant church where new people join us each week. &nbsp; This is a blessing from God, but it also means that we can’t easily care for each other in the large body of Christ.&nbsp; So just as Paul sent Timothy “to strengthen and encourage you in your faith” I Thess. 3:3, I have seen many “Timothys” carrying each other’s burdens in the women’s group I lead and the group I attend in the evening.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Over the past year and half, I have experienced brothers and sisters in Christ holding me up as my husband’s health gradually got&nbsp; worse ending with him going to be with Jesus on December 2.&nbsp; As he struggled through cancer surgery and infections and eventually congestive heart failure, I sometimes was overwhelmed with the physical caring for him and the emotional sadness of watching him struggle.&nbsp; But God sent many from the two small groups to help carry the burden in various ways.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have often asked the question “how can I help someone – how can I carry their burden.”&nbsp; I now have a living example of that from these friends.&nbsp; I knew they prayed for us – sometimes someone would send a text or email telling me of their prayers or writing a prayer they had prayed for us.&nbsp; Phone calls, cards with notes of encouragement, many delicious meals while he was sick and also after he passed when I wasn’t ready to start cooking for myself. &nbsp; I still have some in my freezer!&nbsp; Gift of a journal with a verse on each page and notes from them to lift me up.&nbsp; One shoveled snow, another brought muffins and came for a visit and invited me to go out for pizza with her.&nbsp; Another helped in planning for the funeral and meals and offered to house an out of town friend.&nbsp; I know that I can call on any of them for help when needed, whether to ask for prayer, to talk or for physical help.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God in His creativity gave others many ways to help carry my burden.&nbsp; Now I will reach out and carry someone’s burden.&nbsp; When you see someone in a hard time, ask God how you can help carry their burden.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer:&nbsp;</strong> Father, You have given me the body of Christ.&nbsp; Help me to live out the “one anothers” of bearing someone’s burden.&nbsp; Give me Your direction of what I can do to help.</p>

      <title>Perseverance</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/4/16/perseverance</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:	“<em>Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.</em>”&nbsp; James 1:4</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>	</strong>While living in a small town in western Virginia, my next door neighbor was a lovely woman who held the title of Master Gardener.&nbsp; Needless to say her plants and flowers were amazing and I always admired her gardening skills.&nbsp; One summer evening she called me and said, “Bonnie, be in my back yard tonight at 9:00 pm.”&nbsp; I couldn’t imagine what she wanted, but I was intrigued and just curious enough to comply.&nbsp; When I arrived, she pointed out one of her large plants, and told me to keep my eyes on it.&nbsp; As we both stood there watching, I was astonished to see, at precisely 9:00, a beautiful, perfectly formed, mature flower literally “pop” open right before our eyes!&nbsp; The plant was an Evening Primrose, and I was delighted to watch as its other flowers also popped open one by one - I had never seen anything like it.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	Have you ever thought it be wonderful if we could find spiritual maturity in that way?&nbsp; Just pop out and suddenly “be” the mighty woman or man of God that we desire to be, complete and perfect, ready to take on any task or trial with total confidence?&nbsp; But you know, and I know, that this is not God’s plan for us.&nbsp; His sanctifying work in us can be painstakingly slow, deliberate, and difficult, and He knows that we learn best through adversity.&nbsp; It is through the act and art of living life with Him daily that we are <em>gradually</em> transformed into His likeness. &nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	The Greek word for perseverance, <em>hupomone</em>, is also defined as <em>endurance</em> or <span style="text-decoration:underline">patience</span> – each closely linked in meaning, and each a crucial part of a mature believer’s faith.&nbsp; But how do we learn perseverance?&nbsp; Someone once said that if you ask God for boldness, you need to be bold!&nbsp; Likewise, if you want to learn perseverance, you must persevere!</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Persevere through the Word</span>.&nbsp; Our enemies would love to destroy us, our faith and our future.&nbsp; Recently I shared how years ago Satan actually sent the pastor of my small church to attack, accuse, and condemn me – shaking my faith to its very foundation.&nbsp; I began to emotionally spiral downward until I questioned even God’s love and my own salvation.&nbsp; After many tears and sleepless nights, I turned to His Word and rediscovered the TRUTH about myself and His great love for me.&nbsp; I learned, and now “I know for sure” that I am saved, the Holy Spirit is within me, that Jesus loves me, and nothing can separate me from that love.&nbsp; Are you struggling with your identity as a child of God and feeling somewhat lost?&nbsp; Turn to His Holy Word – it is alive and powerful, a source of reassurance and hope, and eternal truth that will stand forever. </p></li><li><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Persevere through Prayer</span>.&nbsp; I will admit that growing up as a young believer, prayer was never my strong suit.&nbsp; It was difficult to make time to pray and to keep my focus on God whenever I did.&nbsp; I’m learning, however, that there is no substitute for spending serious time with God.&nbsp; Prevailing prayers, pleading prayers, heart-rending prayers, and brutally honest prayers are most pleasing to Him.&nbsp; Prayer allows for intimacy with the Father, humbles us before Him and softens our hearts, it cleanses our souls and releases our spirits.&nbsp; In the midst of our brokenness, prayer brings us back into a right relationship with God, it brings healing, and restores hope.&nbsp; And, “Hallelujah, He’s a prayer-answering God!”</p></li><li><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Persevere through Community</span>.&nbsp; Late last year I was diagnosed with an unusual and serious illness.&nbsp; During the earliest days and weeks of the treatment I was given, I actually found it very difficult to pray, and sometimes impossible as I struggled with the physical challenges and emotional realities of my condition.&nbsp; But praise God, my precious brothers and sisters in Christ rallied around me and prayed on my behalf!&nbsp; They were such a tremendous blessing, especially as they prayed, but also as they cooked meals, sent cards, e-mails and texts, made phone calls and visited me in the hospital and at home – reaching out in love, compassion and concern.&nbsp; This was a beautiful picture of community at work within the Body of Christ, humbling but heart-warming, God-ordained and real.&nbsp; In community we help one another to persevere.</p></li></ul><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:	Lord Jesus, you’ve told us in Your Word that “<em>The one who perseveres to the end shall be saved.</em>”&nbsp; (Matt. 24:13)&nbsp; We thank you for this assurance, for we do indeed long to see You face to face and to receive the crown of life you promised.&nbsp; Until that day, help us to walk along the path set before us with endurance, patience, and faithfulness.&nbsp; And should we ever be tempted to give up or stray away, may we echo the words of Peter in faith, “Lord, to whom shall we go?&nbsp; You have the words of eternal life.”</p>

      <title>Grace Upon Grace</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/4/23/grace-upon-grace</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have two cats.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Stanley, a sandy beige colored tomcat with a sweet and affectionate personality, was raised in our home lovingly since he was adopted as a very small kitten. Simon, a jet black, rambunctious, yet strikingly handsome fellow, was adopted as a young adult cat.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Stanley and Simon are always together, like two peas in a pod. When I go outside with my children on a beautiful sunny day, both cats come running up to get their due allowance of petting and human time. Stanley allows me to pet him and doesn’t seem to care when my children pull his tail or rub his fur the wrong way.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Simon, however, is a different story. I almost always get a glimpse of his unknown past-as he seeks attention and allows me to pet him, only to suddenly sink his teeth into my hand as I stroke his midnight black coat.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And while so many people would just refuse to have any contact with that seemingly spiteful and ungrateful cat, I continue to work with him. Over time, with love, Simon has improved with his trust and his behavior. While I know I may still get bitten, I know that Simon’s past is not something he can change, and so I choose to love him anyway.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How many of us have the same story? We have a past that is marked by brokenness and scars that we cannot change, and yet we still seek love from others. Others often see only our past when they look at us, and refuse to see the change in our hearts or the potential for change if we are shown love and a positive example.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus loves us no matter what we have done or what our past looks like. If you ask Him to come into your heart and repent of your sins, He will, without question, create a new person while washing away the stains of your past. Trust Jesus with your life today, and He will bring the gift of True Love into your heart.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.”</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer:&nbsp; Lord, please help me to love others despite the past they carry with them.&nbsp; I know you love me, and have forgiven me, and that the old has passed away.&nbsp; Let me be an example of your love and forgiveness as you show me grace upon grace.&nbsp; Thank you for loving me Lord, despite my brokenness.</p>

      <title>Finding Hope in Stinky Circumstances</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/4/30/finding-hope-in-stinky-circumstances</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>“Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and put on manure.”</em> –Luke 13:8</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When life is hard – when everything seems to be going wrong – how can we think about our circumstances in a way that protects us from being gripped by anxiety, bitterness, or hopeless despair? Consider the following fictional scenario:&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Kate’s sweet and thoughtful daughter Akira has been invaded by the body snatchers. Or maybe just a wicked case of teenage hormones from the fiery nether regions. Akira’s constant put downs and outright contempt drag Kate into the pit of despair. Every night, she tosses and turns, wracked with anxiety over the state of the relationship. Every morning, she kicks herself, knowing today will <em>not</em> be the day she has enough energy to sign up for the volunteer project she’s been avoiding.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Is there anything Kate could be doing differently? For months now, she’s been begging God to change Akira’s heart, to no avail. “<em>Could it be, Lord, </em>she prayed<em>, that You are using Akira to change something in me??”</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One day, in her quiet time, she came across a parable that confirmed her suspicions.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And he told this parable: “A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none. And he said to the vinedresser, ‘Look, for three years now I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and I find none. Cut it down. Why should it use up the ground?’</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>And he answered him, ‘Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and put on manure. Then if it should bear fruit next year, well and good; but if not, you can cut it down.’”</em> – Luke 13:6-9</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Immediately Kate felt a prick in her conscience – first about the volunteer work she’d been avoiding, but also about how complacent she’d been in ‘seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness’. In the margins of her Bible she wrote, “The vinedresser was caring, patient and wise! He knew exactly what conditions were necessary to produce fruit. So, he put on manure. <em>He put on manure!”&nbsp;</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As if with a new set of eyes, Kate thought about Akira’s hostility. <em>Before</em>, all she could see was piles and piles<em> </em>of manure. But <em>now </em>she saw God’s hand in it – his merciful hand, patiently working to help her grow and experience the joy of bearing fruit! “God <em>made</em> me to be fruitful,” Kate wrote in her prayer journal. “But my fruit won’t mature if I let it be choked by ‘life’s worries, riches and pleasures.’ Lord, please help me persevere and ‘produce a good crop’” &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Reflection:&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What good fruit would grow in a garden without some high-quality fertilizer? What good fruit will God produce in us when we recognize His hand in stinky circumstances?&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Lord, please open my eyes to see your good purposes in hard times.”&nbsp;</p>

      <title>Unforgiveness</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/4/9/unforgiveness</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other just as Christ forgave us.”&nbsp;</em> Ephesians 4:32</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I want to share a little background.&nbsp; My mom was an alcoholic and I grew up in a very dysfunctional family.&nbsp; I was the oldest of 3 children and it was made known all through my life that I was an annoyance and inconvenience to her.&nbsp; As I got older her only words to me were that of “I wasn’t good enough or lovable or couldn’t do anything right.”&nbsp; I moved out as soon as I turned 18.&nbsp; Several years later when Lee and I got married, we both came to know the Lord.&nbsp; I knew this unforgiveness of my mom was not what God wanted for me, but I could not come to grips with the anger I felt toward my mom. &nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My walk with the Lord was getting stronger and He was growing me, as I stepped out of my comfort zone in obedience to Him.&nbsp; But I still had this unforgiveness toward my mom hanging over my head. About 5 years ago, I was so sick and tired of this cycle I was in and wanted so desperately to be free of my feelings of unforgiveness.&nbsp; I got on my knees and prayed for God to take away every bad memory I had and soften my heart to accept my mom for who she was.&nbsp; For me, it happened at once. I do know this is often times not the norm, it can be a process.&nbsp; I no longer looked at her in the same way and did not have memories of the accounts of wrong doings she had committed against me. I had a list of all the hurts and could recite them in a moment’s notice, but I cannot recall that list even to this day. I felt a huge weight was lifted. &nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We never had a close relationship, but the last 5 years of her life was comfortable when we were together.&nbsp; I am thankful for God’s grace to me and allowing me to see my mom through His eyes.&nbsp; The freedom to allow myself to know and believe who I am in Christ, and not the words my mom spoke to me, was is like a breath of fresh air.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What God taught me in the years following is that forgiving others is a critical part to our spiritual walk. Harboring unforgiveness is like saying come on in Satan wreak havoc in my life. But I know even after we forgive, sometimes the wound itself may continue to need more healing in some cases.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For me, something I sometimes struggle with is distinguishing between what is my part, and what is God’s part.&nbsp; I have found that forgiveness isn’t about having more faith. It is about obedience. Forgiveness is our responsibility and choice, not God’s. We need to choose to forgive. Why- because God forgave us, and He tells us to do so.&nbsp; Just take a moment and think about the things God has forgiven you for in your lifetime.&nbsp; Another difficulty I sometimes have is the disconnect between my head and my heart.&nbsp; I know the truths of what the Bible says, but sometimes I do not act on them or live them out. We must immerse ourselves in His word, it will cause a heart change.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Honestly until we forgive, we remain in the enemy’s grip.&nbsp; We must forgive for our own freedom.&nbsp; If we do what God asks of us, He will do what we cannot do on our own - change our heart.&nbsp; Corrie ten Boom said, “Forgiveness is the key which unlocks the door of resentment and the handcuffs of bitterness”.&nbsp; Brothers and sisters in Christ, forgiveness is not easy, but unforgiveness is a life in chains.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father, continue to instill in us the desire to be in your word and live it out.&nbsp; Help us to have your heart of forgiveness, not particularly for our transgressors, but for our transformation.&nbsp; You alone are our peace!!&nbsp; May we be more and more like you each day! In Jesus precious name. Amen</p>

      <title>Serving with His Eyes</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/5/14/serving-with-his-eyes</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“However, I consider my life worth nothing to me; my only aim is to finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me—the task of testifying to the good news of God’s grace.”&nbsp;</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Acts 20:24</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For most of my preteens into teens I was always at church. My dad had turned a life of drugs and alcohol into a life of pursuing Christ, which for him meant becoming a youth pastor. When I say we were always at church, I often felt like I saw the walls of our youth room more than my own house. People would say things like, “thank you for all that you do with our church,” or “you’re always serving with such a grateful heart.” At times I loved what we did at church and the ways we were able to help and serve others, but by the end of high school it was something I felt I had to do, since I was the “youth pastor’s kid.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I went off to college and attended church, but never truly got “plugged in.” I told myself I was too busy or it would stress me out too much with school, but the truth was I was selfish and fearful that I wouldn’t be good enough at whatever I was tasked with.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Fast forward to the year after I graduated college and I found myself spending a year overseas in many different countries, doing mission work. It was during this time that I saw people hike hours, literally, in the foothills of Mt. Everest to worship and serve their communities, people rebuilding homes of people they knew nothing about, and loving on people who literally cursed them because they were believers. Many of them told me the reason they still served was because someone served them and that was how they came to know Jesus.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Slowly in these moments God began to show me how He sees His children. He began to show me how he created each unique life, each unique heart. This was when I began to serve with an overflowing, abundant heart. Volunteering at the Point has only further solidified the importance of serving, having the opportunity to serve the community in which I live and a people that I’ve come to know and love.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we serve, we are so close to God, His nature, His character. His own son spent His entire life on earth serving others so they could know Him. How amazing is it that we have the opportunity, that He invites us in to let someone else experience Him by our service?&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father, help me and each of us to see that you’ve given us a gift and opportunity when we serve. Help us to see others the way that you see them, for when we do, we will never want anything more than to be the hands and feet of Jesus. Thank you for bringing us in to your kingdom and giving us the chance to show and help someone know you. Thank you for giving us life and joy as we serve one another.&nbsp;</p>

      <title>Why I Volunteer</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/5/21/why-i-volunteer</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Focus verse</strong>: Mark 10:45 <em>“For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."</em>&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One of the reasons why I love this verse is because our example, Jesus, never calls us to do anything he hasn’t already done for all of us. The King of kings was born in a manger, humbled himself, and took a lowly position as a servant.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Around this time last year, I was not serving or volunteering at the Point. I didn’t really have an understanding of why I should serve and the significance of serving. The reason why I joined was because I was listening to a pastor speak and he talked about when you volunteer and serve at church and surround yourself with a community of believers you begin to get into a flow of people who are on the same path and pursuit of the same Godly things as you. And it’s funny because just a few weeks ago I was chatting with the head coach for the UVA boy’s basketball team Tony Bennett at an event and he was telling me how he actually met his wife volunteering and serving in the youth ministry.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Through volunteering at the Point and serving with the high school students, God is building my character. He’s teaching me valuable lessons that are preparing me for my destiny and the plan that he has for my life and he wants to do the same for all of us. When you serve where God has placed you and are faithful in things that seem insignificant, character begins to be developed in you where He prepares you for your destiny.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ, we though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others. We each have different gifts according to the grace given to each of us”</em> (Romans 12:4-6)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We all play a pivotal role in the body of Christ to serve with the gifts that God has placed in us to the rest of the world. How can you help make a difference through your service where God has uniquely placed you?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God, thank you for placing us right where we are now. Help us to be faithful in the little things that you’ve called us to be obedient in and build in us a humble spirit. Give us wisdom to see the value in serving and help us to find our place in your kingdom to help make a difference. In Jesus name, we agree.</p>

      <title>Why I Serve in StudentLife</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/5/28/why-i-serve-in-studentlife</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>“</em></strong><em>In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.”</em> (Matthew 5:16 ESV)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">These days, the brightest and most frequent light our students may see is their phone. If I’m being honest, I should include myself in that. Though, not everything we see on our phones is harmful. God can be glorified through sending encouraging text messages, showing love through social media, or consoling a friend on a phone call. However, our phones can also make us accessible to messages that promote hatred, evil, and fear. Given this reality, it is very important for our students to be involved in a spiritual community.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I could describe my teenage years as three things: cringeworthy, even more cringeworthy, and full of growth. As painful as it might be to look back, I believe there’s an important reason that “cringeworthy” is a stereotypical description for our teenage years. Those years are a crucial time of identity formation as we grow into adults. We try new things, make mistakes, and celebrate our successes. We ask tough questions because we’re looking for answers on how to “do life.” Going through all of this can be emotionally draining for teens and can lead them to develop mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression. I serve in student ministry because I’ve seen firsthand the effects of teen suicide on my family and a community. Students need to know the love and strength God can provide during our darkest moments.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In addition to trying to figure out how to “do life”, teenagers have many pressures on them. They are balancing jobs, extracurricular activities, school assignments, and their family’s calendar. Oh right, they also have to find time for God somewhere in there. Does this last one sound relatable? The most important relationship in our lives gets placed on the backburner due to earthly pressures. The only time some of our students have to get to know God is during StudentLife events. How I see it, every moment we spend with students in StudentLife may be critical to their salvation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How do you currently have an impact on students? Do you work with them directly? Maybe you try to distance yourself from teenagers. Even then, do you come across them from time to time in real life? Adults are seen as role models, even from afar. How can you take one step to better encourage students’ spiritual development? How can we make God’s love the brightest and most frequent light in students’ lives?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus, I am so thankful for your unconditional love and grace. Give us the wisdom and strength to be good role models for our students. Let our words and actions shine brightly as Your love for the students in our communities. Amen.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p>

      <title>Freedom From Perfection</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/5/7/freedom-from-perfection</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“<em>But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.” </em><strong><em>2 Corinthians 12:9</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Do you ever feel like you’re failing at everything? No matter what you do, or the control you try to hold tightly on to, you’re just never hitting the mark, stride, sweet spot of peace and happiness that you ‘think’ will make life better and easier. I have to confess that I feel this way, quite often. I’m a lover of control, of keeping things peaceful at all times, and keeping conflict far away and a perfectionist to my core.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I know I cannot be alone in this, and that many of us deal with depression, anxiety, and lack of joy, because of the unreal expectations we pile onto ourselves.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can imagine how these things gather together (in a self-made grenade of implosion), as I am also a ministry wife, mother of two kids ages 5 and under, and trying to find my footing in a new state and new home. Can I tell you that while I am always grappling with these burdens, because I’ll never find perfection this side of eternity, I have found joy and peace to counteract it all? Would you like to know the source? Jesus.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My need for control and perfection took a massive hit in the fall of 2017. We were expecting our third child, and quietly hoping for a boy to add to our family of girls. At 20 weeks pregnant I was at the gender reveal ultrasound, by myself, and was told that our child was no longer living. I can remember in the moments leading up to this bombshell, as things seemed off and not quite right, I was alone and staring at the sterile, cold ceiling. I said out loud in an empty room, ‘Jesus, I think I’m about to need you like never before. Please be near.’</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I composed myself, tear soaked and barely able to see, and I drove home. We called to be admitted to the hospital, labor was induced, and twelve hours later we delivered our baby into a quiet room. Every single part of my life was spinning out of control. Control I’ve always tried to hold onto so tightly. Peace was elusive. Grief was all encompassing. Lies from the devil took root in my heart, and all the things that trauma does to you became my new normal.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We had the most incredible support system of prayer, love, and care. I could not have survived without it. My sweet husband played a constant stream of worship music, from the drive to the hospital and all the way through to our drive home, leaving our baby behind. This one act on his part is probably what saved me. Constantly keeping our focus on Jesus. (By the way, we got to briefly hold and see the face of our hoped-for son. He was perfect.)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The story of loss never ends, and the journey through immense heartbreak and crippling anxiety has been one that only Jesus and I know the depths of. You see though I had a choice, we all do, actually, which road will we take? The one that leads to self-reliance, covering up, putting on old masks, and acting like we have it all together? This path leads ultimately to our own undoing. There’s another choice, although it’s painful and requires a lot of self-sacrifice. It’s a way of complete surrender, and opening the ugly, imperfect parts of our story that we don’t like at all. It’s a choice to fully, unreserved, with all that we have, go after Jesus. Actually, we don’t really have to go far at all. He’s ever present, and always waiting to wrap us up in His peace-filled embrace. Because did you know, He has scars too? He is the only one to have ever walked this earth that knows the EXACT level of your disappointment, anxiety, fears, hurt and brokenness. He took it all upon himself on the cross. Although He is totally God, He was also human, and He was taking on every ounce of what that means, in order to save us. To save you.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That’s the realization I had to come to, and the depth of the love that brought me into freedom. I believe you can find it too. You’re not failing. You’re actually living and learning what works or doesn’t. You can never reach perfection here on earth, so go ahead and give it up. Your anxiety is built on lies that the devil would love to use to keep you down. God’s truth says this: <em>“Let those who fear the Lord say, "His steadfast love endures forever." Out of my distress I called on the Lord; the Lord answered me and set me free. The Lord is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do to me?”</em> Psalms 118:4-6.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Here’s all that you need to do, right now. Make your life one of unending worship and relationship with Him. Constantly laying everything down at the feet of the One who just wants you to give it up already. It’s hard and I miss the mark a lot. I am an imperfect person here! You will miss the marks too, but choosing Jesus before ourselves is grace and freedom in its truest form. I’m sick of feeling inadequate. I’m doing something about it, how about you?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br><strong><em>Prayer</em></strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Jesus, I don’t want to carry these burdens anymore. I’m so tired, weary, and done with feeling inadequate and broken. Trying to put on a mask of perfection. I know that you say to lay it all at Your feet, so here I am. I am an open book to You. Please wrap me in peace and in your healing love.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>My only desire is to know You more. I will stay here in this special place of just You and I, I will listen for Your voice.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>I praise you for all that You are, and for all that You did for me on the cross. For you to step down from Heaven and feel everything that I’m feeling right now, is the greatest love I’ve ever known. Thank you. I love you. I want freedom. </em></p>

      <title>Why I Attend A Group</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Even in old age they will still produce fruit, they will remain vital and green; they will declare, The Lord is just!&nbsp; He is my rock! There is not evil in Him.”</em>&nbsp; <strong>Ps 92:14-15 – NTL</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am grateful for the fruit bearing promise of Psalm 92 because I didn’t even get planted until middle age.&nbsp; I was saved on a Friday evening, April 11, 1997.&nbsp; I am happy to share my salvation story if you ask me.&nbsp; That night changed my life forever – gave me a purpose and passion that thankfully has not dimmed in over twenty years.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Giving your life to Jesus at any age can dramatically affect your relationships.&nbsp; You begin to think differently, act differently, “want” differently.&nbsp; Even as a church goer there is a shift in your relationships.&nbsp; For almost twenty years I persevered in prayer and fellowship with women I deeply loved in a Women’s Bible Study.&nbsp; A time came when I could no longer stay true to my understanding of the Bible, and I left that church. &nbsp; I found the Point through the invitation of some friends who had left before I did.&nbsp; I knew I had found “home” the very first Sunday in September 2016.&nbsp; The music, the preaching, and most powerfully, the invitation to others to accept Jesus as Lord and Savior, thrilled my heart.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It took me a year to join a women’s group.&nbsp; Looking back, I don’t know why.&nbsp; Well, yes, I do.&nbsp; After I left my former church, I had continued in Bible study with these women I still love.&nbsp; It took God’s putting a book, He had put on my heart several years prior, that I could never persuade the other women to study, on the heart of a Point group leader.&nbsp; I found this out during a “chance” encounter with her.&nbsp; I use more quotation marks since knowing God.&nbsp; With Him there are not coincidences.&nbsp; I signed up!!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Although I had been in a women’s Bible study with the same group of women for a long, long time, it had not prepared me for what community means at The Point.&nbsp; I give God all the glory for what The Point version means.&nbsp; It means transparency, it means accountability, it means intimacy, all with Jesus as the focus.&nbsp; It means so much more than friendship and for me it means a constant reigniting of that purpose and passion I mentioned earlier.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The women in my group have helped me look into the face of Jesus.&nbsp; I know Him better because we seek Him together, every week, through prayer and study, and often by texts and phone calls throughout the week as life presses in.&nbsp; We are bearing fruit in our lives for His kingdom, in and for each other, and beyond.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer – Father, thank you for my salvation.&nbsp; Thank you for the wonderful group of women who love you, who surround and encourage me, as we live our lives together for your glory.&nbsp; Amen</p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>'Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. John would have prevented him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?" But Jesus answered him, "Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he consented.”</em> - <strong>Matthew 3:13-15</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In January 2006, I had a wild idea: I would apply to graduate school.&nbsp; It might not seem that wild now, but in January 2006, I had only been teaching for 5 years, I had a one year old at home, and a husband who would start attending classes toward his own degree.&nbsp; I was heavily involved in student activities and regularly up late grading papers or writing lesson plans.&nbsp; I envisioned that one day I might want to become a school leader - an assistant principal, a principal, or a district curriculum writer.&nbsp; By that point, I hadn’t even served as a department chair.&nbsp; I had no leadership experience.&nbsp; But I imagined that one day, I would want that kind of leadership - and I needed to be prepared. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I reflect on who I was in 2006, I understand that I wasn’t where I needed to be yet. &nbsp; I didn’t have the minimum requirements to apply for a position.&nbsp; I hadn’t served on the teams or in the roles that would prepare me for leadership opportunities.&nbsp; I was just a great teacher with the desire that one day I might want to do more. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Fortunately, Jesus provides a model of preparation.&nbsp; As Jesus was preparing to enter ministry, he went to be baptized by John the Baptist.&nbsp; Even when John protested, asking “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me,” Jesus insisted.&nbsp; Jesus had all that he needed to begin his ministry, but he fulfilled the requirement anyway, demonstrating for us how necessary it is for us to be prepared for what God will do in our lives.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I wonder how many of us have been obedient to God’s call to preparation.&nbsp; We cannot imagine all that God will do in our lives, all of the lives we will reach, all the work He will do through us, all the changes He will orchestrate in our hearts.&nbsp; He’s telling us to get ready.&nbsp; Get that degree.&nbsp; Apply for that position.&nbsp; Start studying the Word.&nbsp; Apply for your passport.&nbsp; Start building that relationship. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I would hate to miss an opportunity to serve God because I wasn’t ready for it.&nbsp; So I’m getting prepared.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lord, I want to be ready for what you’re calling me to, what you’re awakening in my heart.&nbsp; Show me how you want me to ready myself. &nbsp;</p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“I should be spiritually free and expressive as I pray, but I should also be thoughtful and mindful as I pray.&nbsp;&nbsp;I should sing with my spirit and sing with my mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you give a blessing using your private prayer language, which no one else understands, how can some outsider who has just shown up and has no idea what’s going on know when to say ‘Amen’?&nbsp;&nbsp;Your blessing might be beautiful, but you have very effectively cut that person out of it.”</em><br><strong> -&nbsp;1 Corinthians 14:16-17 (MSG)</strong><br> <br> I used to not be a pray-out-loud kind of girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying those intimate words so loud that others can hear them seemed awkward at best, and pushy at worst.&nbsp;&nbsp;The exception of course is grace around the dinner table with family, when it’s understood to be more of a cultural experience at least for my family of Southern roots, but when I am really talking to God I’ve always felt privacy was the best method for me.<br> <br> Just over two years ago, my husband and I welcomed a beautiful baby boy into the world, and he was more amazing than I could have ever prayed for.&nbsp;&nbsp;But things took a turn for the worst when he was around three months old that left every one of Charlottesville’s pediatric providers scratching their heads.&nbsp;&nbsp;He refused to breastfeed or bottle feed, he had intense startle reflexes preventing him from sleeping more than 43 minutes in a row, he randomly stopped breathing, and most of all, he was “failure to thrive.”&nbsp;&nbsp;That term, to all of you folks out there who haven’t encountered it intimately, is a terrifying one to hear with regard to your own child.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was hospitalized when he was four months old with an EEG on his sweet baby scalp and specialists checking in around the hour.&nbsp;No one seemed to understand why he was experiencing those symptoms, and watching the scales slide backwards hurt me in the pit of my stomach more than anything I’ve experienced before or after.<br> <br> It was during this very public hospitalization that my husband and I had to put down our veil of privacy over prayer.&nbsp;&nbsp;With a constant stream of doctors and nurses and other providers visiting our son’s bedside, there just wasn’t an opportunity to pray over our son alone and in solitude.&nbsp;&nbsp;We had no other option than to pray, and pray out loud, and pray out loud in front of whomever happened to be in the room at that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was far outside of my comfort zone, but it was the only thing that relieved that pit in my stomach.<br> <br> I hoped I could say that with our public prayers, a miracle happened, and he was immediately healed.&nbsp;But God doesn’t always work like that, and I sure am grateful He doesn’t!&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the course of a few more months our son got better, and we received apologetic phone calls from the providers who misdiagnosed him.&nbsp;&nbsp;With time he grew into a healthy, strong baby and at two and a half years old now, you’d never know he struggled so much in his infancy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Fast forward the story, though, to last fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were expecting another baby and had just crossed the threshold to the second trimester.&nbsp;On the morning of a previously scheduled ultrasound, the bleeding started… and it didn’t stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;I ended up hemorrhaging so much blood that I lost consciousness numerous times until I finally coded on the hospital bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The emotional and physical pain was more than I wanted to bear.&nbsp;&nbsp;The last words I spoke to my husband before I coded were, “I just don’t want to be in this body anymore.”<br></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> A near-death experience is not something that could ever fit into the confines of a one-time story, let alone a blog post.&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m sharing this with you to show how God’s plan is so much better than we can ever conceive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because in that moment when my heart wasn’t able to pump the blood it needed to, when the nurses raised the foot of my bed high in the air so blood could flow to the upper half of my body, with alarms beeping loudly and rapidly, when dozens of people suddenly flooded my hospital room… I couldn’t see a thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn’t feel a thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I could hear.<br> <br> And what I heard was my husband praying out loud.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not quietly, privately, reservedly, or timidly; no, he was all-in-praying-out-loud.&nbsp;We hadn’t really prayed out loud together since the fear of losing our son, but my husband prayed as freely and as energetically as if he’d been doing it every moment of his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard every word.&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember making a conscious choice to go back into my body even though I knew the alternative was painless and I desperately wanted a relief from the pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;His prayers saved me.<br> <br> I had spent months and months confused by God that our prayers for our son in the hospital didn’t instantly heal him, and angry at the trauma God put me through as a result of that experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;Little did I know that God had a much bigger plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now our family of four doesn’t just pray at the dinner table, we pray out loud together… all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our daughter has learned the power of prayer at the age of four and our son is memorizing the Bible verses we pray out loud over him.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br> If that’s not the biggest reason to say “Amen,” what is?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Thank you, Lord, for always knowing our needs even before we do</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Acts 2:42 </strong>“They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to <strong>fellowship</strong>, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	The word fellowship in this verse is the word <strong><em>Koinonia</em></strong> in the original Greek language. Koinonia encompasses much more than just what its definition entails. It does mean “fellowship” or “communion” and we can understand it as such in the English language, however, it means a fullness of community and essentially a participation in the body of Christ. As believers we have a bond that transcends all that separates us as humans, societal and economics backgrounds, ethnicity, race, and the like. We have a relationship with Christ where he transforms us by His sacrifice on the cross and welcomes us as sons and daughters into His glorious kingdom of light. This creates a communion that is deeper even than the blood that twin brothers would share. This is the strength of the word Koinonia.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our group environments are meant to be places where we truly live out the calling for authentic and blessed community. When my wife and I first came to The Point, the very first Sunday we stepped foot into the church, we were invited to a community group. We were immediately swept up in an authentic community of believers who shared life together. We shared meals together, cried together, prayed together, served the community together, ultimately grew together. The true fellowship of believers is deeper than a social club or a weekly gathering to just ‘catch up’ or have something to fill your calendar. It is as Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the great pastor and theologian who died at the hand of the Nazis said,&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I have community with others and I shall continue to have it only through Jesus Christ. The more genuine and the deeper our community becomes, the more will everything else between us recede, the more clearly and purely will Jesus Christ and his work become the one and only thing that is vital between us. We have one another only through Christ, but through Christ we do have one another, wholly, for eternity.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer:&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Thank you Lord that as a believer I get to experience true community. I get to experience fellowship as you meant it to be prior to our Fall in the garden. True fellowship only comes from being in communion with You and in communion with your people. Surround me with those to encourage me to be more like you and to live a life that drives more people to You.</p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago.”</em> <strong>Ephesians 2:10</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My granddaughter has autism. My beautiful, sweet granddaughter has danced to a different drummer for a while now. I knew there was something about her that made her a little different. She is highly intelligent, has always been extremely verbal with a vocabulary way beyond her age. She is affectionate and compassionate and the only person in her family who really loves their cat. How could she be autistic?&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am so grateful I had my wonderful community group of women to share this news with shortly after I found out. We were studying a lesson about Ruth and Naomi. We discussed how we often believe the labels we and others attach to us over the way our heavenly Father, our perfect Creator, sees us. Not surprisingly, I lost it before it was even time to share prayer requests! All I could think about was how my beautiful girl was going to have to deal with labels times ten as an autistic child. How was her little spirit not going to be crushed by ignorant people who don’t know her or understand autism? Thankfully, on that day one Scripture after another reminded me that God is our label maker, not us, not other people. My little granddaughter already has a sweet love for Jesus that will be nurtured by her parents and grandparents. My prayer for her is that she will hold God’s sweet words, His truths, in her heart and wear them like a shield. I pray she will truly understand she is a chosen child of God. God has a unique and special plan for my granddaughter as He does for each of my five granddaughters. What a blessing it is to know that!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We all need to put on the armor of God each and every day. We are not the labels we and others give us. No one knows us like our Father, and no person will ever love us the way He does. Psalm 34:8 says “Open your mouth and taste, open your eyes and see - how good God is. Blessed are you who run to him.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father, you have created me from your image and for a purpose. Help me to remember to put on your armor every day so that I may live for you. Give me the courage to run to you first when I face trials. Help me to see myself as you see me - beloved and chosen. In Jesus’ name, amen.&nbsp;</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Matthew 9:12 &amp;13b</strong>&nbsp;“When Jesus heard this, he said, ‘Healthy people don’t need a doctor – sick people do.’ Then He added…’For I have come to call not those who think they are righteous, but those who know they are sinners’.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus and his disciples were having dinner with Matthew, who was a tax collector.&nbsp; Of course, the Pharisees didn’t miss an opportunity to be critical and complain to the disciples as to who’s dinner invitation Jesus had accepted.&nbsp; In the Pharisee’s opinion, Matthew and his friends, the other disreputable sinners, were scum and not worth anyone’s time, especially Jesus, but….wait! Hmmm…this situation could be an opportunity FINALLY to prove that Jesus wasn’t who he said he was.&nbsp; So, after complaining to the disciples, but before the disciples had a chance to make any comments or give any answers, Jesus spoke with what is recorded in Matthew 9:12 &amp; 13b.&nbsp; Jesus’ answers always went straight to the core of the issue and he explained it in a way that was….well, it should have been easy to understand, shouldn’t it? &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Pharisees could not see their own blindness, their unrighteousness and quite honestly, their “own hand in front of their face”.&nbsp; They truly thought they were righteous and therefore saw no sin in their lives.&nbsp; Therefore, no need for a Savior.&nbsp; Matthew, on the other hand, knew exactly who he was…it was public knowledge.&nbsp; Everyone knew about those tax collectors.&nbsp; They cheated, stole, “skimmed off the top”; Matthew knew he was a sinner.&nbsp; He felt there was no hope for him, so I’m sure he had reconciled himself to a life of sin. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Then…one day, Matthew met JESUS!&nbsp; Five life-changing words…one day I met JESUS, one day you met JESUS!&nbsp; And the unexplainable happened, eyes were opened and immediately Matthew, me, you…we were aware that as sinners, we had just found our Savior.&nbsp; It really wouldn’t have mattered if the disciples had offered an explanation before JESUS said anything, Matthew wasn’t listening to them.&nbsp; He was only hearing the words of JESUS, “I have come to call not those who think they are righteous, but those who know they are sinners”.&nbsp; Matthew knew he was a sinner and for the first time, he discovered there was hope for him, there was a Savior.&nbsp; He didn’t have to continue to live as a sinner nor die as a sinner.&nbsp; He had experienced the glorious revelation that Jesus had come to save him from his sins.”&nbsp; From that day forward, Matthew never ceased to follow Jesus. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The glorious news is…we don’t have to cease following JESUS either!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer:&nbsp; Father God, you are holy and just; you are loving and kind; you are patient and never give up on us.&nbsp; Thank you, Father, for your magnificent obsession with your children.&nbsp; As we ponder Matthew’s encounter with Jesus, please remind each of us of our individual encounters with Jesus.&nbsp; Oh, Father, that we would so vividly remember our first encounter with Jesus that we would fall to our knees with the resolve to never cease from following Him.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the precious and holy name of your only son, Jesus Christ!&nbsp; Amen and Amen</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</p>

      <link>/blogfeed/2019/7/23/content-in-todays-material-world</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always be zealous for the fear of the Lord.”</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Proverbs 23:17 NIV</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sometimes I look around and think, “How in the world did these people afford that HUGE house and that Mercedes! I should be able to get that too!”&nbsp; Or, “Wow, my friends are still about to go out most nights!? Must be nice to go out and do whatever you want <em>all</em> the time!”&nbsp; The list goes on.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Why do we think like this?&nbsp; Unfortunately, we are all subject to comparison, but that’s why we need to constantly look to the LORD!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m not saying that if you have a huge house and drive a nice car, you’re a sinner. There are people who are deeply rooted in material possessions. &nbsp; SO many people look to earthly things in order to fill a void in their heart that they can’t seem to fill.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">People in biblical times had this problem. &nbsp; It’s human nature to compare.&nbsp; But comparing doesn’t need to lead to envy. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I had an envious heart. &nbsp; People I was close to bought extravagant things to fill the void in their lives.&nbsp; It was not obvious what they were doing at first, but by God’s grace, I now see.&nbsp; Now, I look at them with sadness.&nbsp; They could have so much more than these earthly things, and it’s free!&nbsp; The great price has already been paid by Christ.&nbsp; They just need to simply accept it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, people like this will continue to look for things to make them content, and they will never find it. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Why envy that?!?&nbsp; There’s no truth in earthly material.&nbsp; It’s all distraction. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How about another take:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">All of us are sinners.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Doesn’t it always seem as though some people get away with everything? &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Example:&nbsp; Two believers were speeding. &nbsp; One of them gets a ticket, the other doesn’t.&nbsp; Could the one that gets the ticket be envious of the other?&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; Both believers ignored the laws of the land.&nbsp; Both technically broke the law.&nbsp; Instead of being envious of getting out of the situation- realize that in fact you both have the same Father and are both in the wrong- one of you just didn’t get “wacked”. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Can you imagine what our lives would be like if we were 100% every second of our days just zealous for our LORD?!&nbsp; We need a paradigm shift in our thinking- which focuses beyond worldly material.&nbsp; &nbsp; Instead of seeing someone with an envious eye- pray for them. Recognize that earthly rewards are deceptions towards the ultimate reality.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Is your heart envious?&nbsp; Is it hard to compare yourself to others without envying them?&nbsp; If so, why?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God, I thank you for continually showing me grace even though I always fall short on worldly things.&nbsp; I pray that you melt away my envious heart but keep me centered and focused on what truly matters, and that is you,&nbsp; your law, and your love. I pray for complete contentment in you.&nbsp; In Jesus’ name; amen</p>

      <title>My Father is always working!</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/7/30/my-father-is-always-working</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus said, “My Father is always working” (John 5:17). We brag about OUR daddies; He brags about HIS Daddy. Recently, I got a rare glimpse “behind the veil” that covers everything that God does for us and protects us from… things that we don’t normally get to see.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A plumber came to fix a leak in my garage wall. He told me to call a roofer and referred one who could come out that day. (For some reason, there seemed to be a sense of urgency inspired by God.)&nbsp; The roofers plugged some holes and were leaving when the older guy told the rookie to get the big ladder down – – he sent him way up the side of the house to a higher point in the wall. There was something that looked odd to him. He just wanted to check it out. The younger guy climbed way up, looked at a very small hole in the wall, pulled something out and yelled, “I found the source of the leak. But you have a bigger problem”.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He reached deep into the exterior wall and pulled out a smoldering PVC drainage pipe. The clear pipe was charred through in places; glowing bright red in other places.&nbsp; It was too hot to touch. There was an insulation “no freeze” wire wrapped around the pipe, which had malfunctioned. Both men looked at me, incredulous and shaken up. God might have just used them to save my house and my life.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This was very deep in the wall. At least the whole side of my wooden house might have been burning, before a smoke alarm would have gone off.&nbsp; By the time any of my neighbors noticed anything – – it might’ve been too late. But GOD SAW. And my Father, Who “is always working”, took care of it!&nbsp; God showed me what He just saved me from, and the picture of that PVC pipe is a perfect example of the enemy’s intentions, how God saves us, what He saves us from, and how He solves all sorts of problems that we never even know about!&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A plumber came to find a leak, and instead a roofer found a fire! It was a burning “secret time bomb”, and God exposed it! He rescued me and I’m sure it’s one of countless times that He has rescued me. I have deep, sweet sleep, total confidence, and many hallelujahs. And I’m nobody special. What He does for me, He does for you. <span style="text-decoration:underline">All the time.</span></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father, thank You that You are always working on our behalf. Thank You that NOTHING ever surprises You! Thank You that You are “El Roi”, the God Who sees (Gen. 16:13) what the one who came to “steal, kill and destroy” is doing, and You save us regularly!&nbsp; Thank You for how You love and take care of Your family all the time.&nbsp; I am so grateful. I love You back. Let my life honor You.</p>

      <title>What Comfort Zone?</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/7/9/what-comfort-zone</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.&nbsp; In all your ways acknowledge Him and He will make your paths straight. </em><strong>Proverbs 3:5-6</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What comfort zone?&nbsp; God has been having me think about this a lot lately.&nbsp; Not only has He had me thinking about it, He has been really pushing me out of mine.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I was recently able to travel to Cuba.&nbsp; This is the sixth (first with The Point) mission trip I have been on.&nbsp; I have to admit; this was the first time I was truly nervous about a trip.&nbsp; You see I’m what I like to call an extroverted introvert. I am a major introvert.&nbsp; Crowds make me anxious and talking to people (especially new people) is not something I excel at.&nbsp; The extroverted part comes from the job I have and the team I serve on at church; in those areas I have to be extroverted.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There were two differences between this trip and previous ones.&nbsp; The first is the other trips were mainly physical. We built houses and worked behind the scenes (Its surprisingly easy to hide behind a 2X4, hammer, and some nails).&nbsp; These were perfect for an introvert. When I heard our focus in Cuba was mainly relational my anxiety kicked in overtime. My introverted side tried to take over and I had to pray through anxious thoughts.&nbsp; Whenever I met a new person or prayed out loud during one of the visits, I had to say a calming prayer before hand, so I could get through it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The second was that the group size was much smaller.&nbsp; It’s hard to hide in a small group. Especially when we each lead devotions and shared our testimonies.&nbsp; It’s one thing to talk to people you may never see again. It’s completely different to share part of your life story with people (some we had really just gotten to know on this trip) you see on a weekly basis.&nbsp; I am so proud of the group I was able to travel with. I am happy to be able to call them friends.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That said, I am so thankful to God for continually pushing me out of my comfort zone.&nbsp; I now see a confidence in myself that I haven’t seen before and I didn’t know I could ever have. Going to Cuba was just the latest step in His amazing plan for me; Cuba was an experience I’ll never forget.&nbsp; Each time I prayed through the anxiety it got easier to do what God wanted me to do. I am so excited to see growth in myself and others as God gets us further out of our comfort zones. Lessons learned from Cuba are that it’s okay to let your guard down, allow people to care about you, let them make your heart happy, and don’t be afraid to dance in the rain.&nbsp; Most importantly, allow God to lead you out of your comfort zone. You won’t regret any of it. He puts us where we need to be; He won’t steer you wrong.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God, I thank you for pushing me out of my comfort zone.&nbsp; I may push back but I am so thankful that you never give up on me.&nbsp; I know that your plans for me are infinitely better than anything I could ever plan.&nbsp; I can’t wait to see what you have planned for the next chapter of my life. I pray that as you lead us out of our comfort zones you ease our fears and help us to live out the trust we know we have in you. In your most precious name, Amen!</p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“For just as&nbsp;the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body,&nbsp;so it is with Christ.”</em> <strong>1 Corinthians 12:12&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As the Connections Director, I get the opportunity to meet a lot of new people week to week. I love hearing their stories, hearing what God is stirring in their hearts, and talking to them about God’s beautifully thought-out and purposeful design for <em>them</em> as individuals. I truly love this! I love the realization people have when God reveals this to them. We are all <em>unique and</em> <em>different</em>! However, I’ve really been thinking more about this as it pertains to all of us as a body of believers.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Something that I think often gets overlooked though, or is maybe taken for granted, is the <em>beauty of our diversity</em>. Throughout 1 Corinthians 12, Paul talks about the many spiritual gifts that we have been given by the Holy Spirit. These gifts all vary person to person. My gifts and personality are not the exact same as yours. We are all different and we were made like this on purpose for a purpose. God did not create us all to be the same carbon copies of each other. Nor should we strive to be like each other. We should be living out who God called us to be and strive to be like <em>Jesus</em>. Together, we have unity in Jesus Christ.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Even so, our flawed human nature wants things <em>our own way</em>. A lot of times we see our differences, and they cause pain and dissension. But, is that really what God intended? Did God design us to be different and then fight one another to make the other fall in line behind us? No. We aren’t calling everyone else to be like us, we should be calling on Jesus to show us, together in unity, the way forward. Together we find a better way. Two minds are greater than one! Our differences make us stronger.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As Christians, we have a great opportunity to approach differences and conflict in a God-honoring way. This is where I like to start. 1) I recognize that the person in front of me is an invaluable, child of God. He created them with love and intentionality. 2) I recognize that they might see things differently than I do, so I want to understand and see how they see. 3) I go to God and pray for wisdom. How do we move forward toward a common good for all? What is God’s best for this situation?&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There will be times that you’re in a tough spot and can’t see eye to eye, that’s a larger discussion for another time. You can’t take control or responsibility for others’ actions. However, you can control and take responsibility for how <em>you approach differences</em>.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Think about your current circumstances: What conflicts are currently in front of you? &nbsp;Are you approaching them in a Godly way? &nbsp;If not, what steps can you take to change your perspective, conversations, and actions?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God, I am incredibly thankful that you have created me and everyone around me uniquely and perfectly in your image. I praise you today that I have brothers and sisters who think and see the world differently, because together we are stronger. Help me to see this truth in every situation and conversation. I pray for your wisdom, your guidance, and your grace – that my words and actions are a reflection of who you are and what you have already done for us in Christ Jesus. In Jesus’ name I pray, amen.&nbsp;</p>

      <title>Therefore Come</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Jesus, undeterred, went right ahead and gave his charge: “God authorized and commanded me to commission you:” </em><strong>Matthew 28:18 MSG</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Therefore go and make disciples of all nations,&nbsp;baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,&nbsp;and teaching&nbsp;them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you&nbsp;always, to the very end of the age.” </em><strong>Matthew 28:19-20 NIV</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Therefore Come</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">During our ‘Out of Commission’ series Pastor Gabe preached on the verses that are known as the “Great Commission” (Matthew 28:18-20). He discussed how our mission field is exactly where God has placed us at any given moment. The “go” in “therefore go” is not necessarily thousands of miles away. Our responsibility and command is constant: we are to make disciples wherever we are. Sometimes though, that “go” <em>is</em> thousands of miles away for some of us. We may feel this nudge on our heart to go on an international mission trip but are not quite ready to say yes.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we start answering His calling, the devil may begin to work overtime. The enemy will tell us that we are not qualified, not equipped, or not spiritual enough to go. Perhaps life and work back home while you are away are keeping you from going, or maybe it is the fundraising that seems impossible. The first twelve followers of Christ were ordinary people like you and me, and look how He used them. The great thing about not being enough is that we are loved by a Father that is <em>beyond</em> enough. He does not call the equipped, He equips the called. His provision is proved over and over again in the Bible.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I love The Message translation of Verse 18, “Jesus, undeterred…” It is time we follow His lead. We should be undeterred in seeking to reach the lost and making disciples. The cost for not obeying that command is far too great. It is about time we start giving Jesus what He paid for. Maybe we should think of “Therefore, go” as “Therefore, COME.” He is already there. As in everything, He has already gone before you and prepared the way for you to serve. He will be with you every step of the way and will take care of everything you leave behind, as we are reminded of at the end of His command in Verse 20. Our God does not answer our obedience with abandonment. If He has placed the desire to go on your heart, do not be sidelined by the enemy’s lies and distractions. He has called you for a specific purpose and will equip you in every way needed.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have you thought about international REACH? Do you feel like this is something you are supposed to do, but are hesitant or do not feel like you have what it takes? Ask yourself two questions: Do I love Jesus? Do I want others to know about that love? If you answered yes to both of those then sign up, He will take care of the rest. If you have never given international missions a thought, I challenge you to ask God to reveal to you how you should be involved. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father, I ask that you start a fire within me to share the gospel relentlessly to those around me. Let my utmost desire be to serve you and further your kingdom no matter where I am. Allow me to lay down my life for you and your will. Use me in whatever capacity you feel fit to win souls for Christ. &nbsp;</p>

      <title>A New Family</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading:&nbsp; </strong><em>“A father of the fatherless, a defender of widows, is&nbsp;God in His holy habitation.&nbsp; </em><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>God sets the lonely in families</em></span><em>.”</em>&nbsp; <strong>Ps. 68:5-6b</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Growing up in a tiny south Louisiana town, my life was filled with family.&nbsp; We were wonderfully close-knit with grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins all living within one mile of each other.&nbsp; Christmas and Thanksgiving, birthdays, hand-cranked ice cream, and summer watermelons were all occasions to be shared and enjoyed by everyone.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Now with the quickly passing years, my family looks quite different.&nbsp; Although I have a great husband and am truly blessed by him and his lovely family, my own grandparents, parents, and favorite aunts and uncles have all passed on.&nbsp; Others are not as close as before, and my only child is now absent from me.&nbsp; Are you ready for some good news?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We read in Philippians that “God shall supply all our needs . . . in Christ Jesus,” and He has met my need for a family with a small group of women at The Point who share with me their community, conversation, companionship and prayers.&nbsp; We sometimes travel together or share a meal, but more importantly, we share our hearts.&nbsp; Connected and drawn together by one Lord Jesus Christ and one kindred Spirit, we are blessed.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It would be difficult to express here what this group has meant to me, but I can truthfully say that it is my privilege and joy to be known and accepted by these exceptional women.&nbsp; They are indeed like family in many ways, and a vivid reminder of God’s constant love and provision in my life.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you’ve been attending The Point but have not yet connected to a community group, please consider it.&nbsp; Our Lord is waiting to supply your need for community and it will be a tremendous blessing in your life.&nbsp; Remember Jesus’ words in Luke’s gospel, “Seek and you shall find.”&nbsp; Step out now, seek and discover all that God has for you and you will find that place where you are known and accepted, your place to belong.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer:&nbsp; </strong>I praise you, Lord, for your goodness and faithfulness towards your children.&nbsp; I am especially grateful for my church and the opportunities for spiritual growth that it affords each one of us.&nbsp; Help me each day to give and receive Your love, and to recognize the importance and benefits of walking in community with other Christians.&nbsp; Make me more aware of all that you have for me and give me the wisdom and courage to reach out and seize these blessings, to your glory and honor.&nbsp; Amen</p>

      <title>Motivation</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/8/6/motivation</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“A person may think their own ways are right, but the LORD weighs the heart</em>.” (Proverbs 21:2)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ve been struggling with writing this very devotional, starting and stopping for days. Feeling uninspired I casually asked the Lord to lead my thoughts. Truthfully, my words felt like pennies tossed into a wishing well. Then, as I flipped through the psalms, my eyes landed on a passage that pressed the pause button in my soul.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Incline my heart to your testimonies, and not to selfish gain!”</em> (Psalm 119:36)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I could almost hear the ding-ding of a railroad crossing bar land in front of me. That moment I recognized what God’s Spirit was after. I’ve authored enough devotionals to know how good it feels to write something someone likes. That last phrase says it all, doesn’t it? I was lacking inspiration because my motivation to please was off track. Instead of writing to please an audience of One, I had your response in mind. Here’s what I know for certain. God cares most about our hearts. Like me, if you feel uninspired, could it be the Lord has stopped you to reveal your motivation? Often, we are interested in pleasing a lesser god like productivity, reputation, or any other thing the world esteems as important.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things; and give me life in your ways.” </em>(Psalm 119:37)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Illusions also snared my imagination from working at its best. For instance, perfectionism and procrastination pressured me to wait for that ideal moment before tackling this project. Sadly, I even entertained the thought of people praising me. I nearly gag on that confession, but I know I’m not alone. Maybe you can relate? Our hearts want to glorify themselves. To clear out this selfish motivation I reflected on these verses allowing them to speak to me. Sometimes our imaginations need to soak in scripture to be drenched with the light and inspiration of God.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Confirm to your servant your promise, that you may be feared.”</em> (Psalm 119:38)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As I turned my attention to these verses, they reassured me. Their straight shot revealed that my shallow motivation had steered me to an empty source - myself. Jesus said, <em>“I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.”</em> (John 15:5) God reveals Himself through lives that are motivated to glorify Him. I was guilty of wanting to impress people. Pride and people-pleasing have no place in the Kingdom of God. Today ask Heavenly Father to purify your motivation. He will inspire you as you aim to please Him.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Reflection:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. Am I motivated to please God or ultimately myself? What is my deepest motivation?&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. What illusions am I believing?&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, cause my heart to bow before You and not to the ideals of this world. Help me turn my eyes away from illusions so that I pursue only that which is true; drench my soul with life as I walk in Your paths. Reassure me of Your promises, for I am your beloved, Your servant who bows before You. (TPT)</p>

      <title>Grand Canyon Love</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/9/10/grand-canyon-love</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“For I will be merciful toward their iniquities, and I will remember their sins no more.” </em><strong>Hebrews 8:12 (RSV)</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>&nbsp;“I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, &nbsp;may have power, together with all the Lord’s holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ.”&nbsp; </em><strong>Ephesians 3:16-18 (NIV)</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1974.&nbsp; Road trip.&nbsp; Arizona. I couldn’t wait to see the Grand Canyon!&nbsp; I’d toured the Kettle Moraine in my home state of Wisconsin, but I knew those rock-deposit crevices would be nothing compared to …THE GRAND CANYON!&nbsp; My impatience grew as we drove next to a deep drop-off to a river below.&nbsp; Suddenly, it hit me… we’d been driving <em>alongside</em> the Grand Canyon for over an hour!&nbsp; There was so much more to it than I’d ever imagined!&nbsp; Fast forward. &nbsp; 2019. Plane trip. Israel. &nbsp; I couldn’t wait to walk…WHERE JESUS WALKED!&nbsp; Hearing our guide’s Hebrew words and explanations gave me a thirst for the culture in which Jesus interacted during His earthly ministry. &nbsp; There was so much more than I’d imagined; ironically, it was because there was so much…less.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Biblical Hebrew has far fewer words than English. Old Testament Hebrew uses only about 5,000 different words, but those words are packed with meaning.&nbsp; Fewer words means each word can have multiple meanings. I became acutely aware of the limitations of a huge English vocabulary – what an oxymoron! Translating some Hebrew words with just one English word often doesn’t paint the complete picture; there is more…&nbsp; much more… Grand Canyon more!&nbsp; Isn’t that just like our majestic God?&nbsp; Romans 11:33a tells us, “Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!”&nbsp; Deeper than any canyon, yet searchable; “Aha!” moments with God, when a word’s meaning suddenly expands….a&nbsp; word like <em>remember</em>.&nbsp; There was the conundrum.&nbsp; If God ‘remembers no more,’ does that mean He forgets? Does He become absent-minded? While that thought brought some vindication for the last time I couldn’t remember where I put my keys, I had a hard time reconciling it to His omniscience. Could our all-knowing God forget – no longer know – something? If so, could He forget me? &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Enter the Hebrew word ‘<em>zakhar’ </em>which is translated ‘remember’ in English, as in Hebrews 8:12: “For I will be merciful toward their iniquities, and I will remember their sins no more.”&nbsp; Yet <em>zakhar</em> holds a Grand Canyon of meaning.&nbsp; Our Western minds link <em>remembering</em> to thought activity, as in thinking about a past event.&nbsp; Jewish understanding expands that to include actions attached to those thoughts; remembering someone in prayer doesn’t just mean thinking about them, but actually praying for them. &nbsp; In the Western sense of ‘no recollection,’ forgotten sins run the risk of returning to memory, leaving them open to punishment. But ‘remembering no more’ in the Jewish context means coupling&nbsp; memories with actions, and God’s action is forgiveness. God’s ‘remembering sins no more’ doesn’t mean He can’t recall them, but that, knowing them all, He consciously decides to forgive!&nbsp; How great is that love? Immeasurable love.&nbsp; Perfect love.&nbsp; Decisive love.&nbsp; It’s God’s mercy for believers regarding the sins He sees and recalls, but that He actively DECIDES to forgive.&nbsp; It’s active recollection that brings complete freedom.&nbsp; It’s peace in trusting that He remembers, yet chooses mercy.&nbsp; It’s Grand Canyon love!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer:&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;Lord, thank You that Your love for us is immeasurable, that Your ways are not our ways, and that deep, canyon trips with You are eye-opening adventures that last forever.&nbsp; Help me to be rooted and established in Your love, Your Word, and to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is Your love for us.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">While spending some much needed “unplugged” time with my family at the beach, my 2 year old son and I were playing in the water. He’s so little, and the waves of the Atlantic are so strong, I refuse to allow him to face the water alone.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He stands with me, looking out at the wondrous waters before him, his wide eyes squinting beneath the brim of his stars and stripes themed sun hat. I hold his hand firmly, and we plant our feet in the sand together as we brace for the crashing waves together. I know that if I let him go, or if he pulled away from me, he would quickly be swept into the strong current of the water, a dangerous situation for a small child.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I think about all the times in my life when I have faced the waves of life crashing into me. The times when I stood firm and held my Heavenly Father’s hand, I did not fall. Then I think to the darkest times of my life, when I pulled away from my Heavenly Father and tried to stand firm on my own. The waves quickly overtook me and I found myself struck down and sucked out into deeper waters, in desperate need of my Father to rescue me.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have you ever been through a time where you tried to stand by yourself against the crashing waves, telling yourself you could handle it without the strong hand of your Heavenly Father? Have you pulled away from God, and been overcome by the deep waters?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Proverbs 10:25 says, “<strong><em>When the storm has swept by, the wicked are gone, but the righteous stand firm forever.</em></strong>”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Know that God is always there standing with you, longing to hold your hand, to stand firm together with you against the waves. If you’ve been overcome and swept into the deep waters, cry out to God and He will be your Rescuer. And once you cry out to Him, and take hold of His strong, guiding hand, don’t ever let go again. Stand firm, hold His hand, and He will help you face the waves of life as they come crashing down.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father and Almighty God, thank you that You are my rescuer.&nbsp; Thank you for saving me.&nbsp; I know that You will help me to stand firm forever against the storms of the enemy.&nbsp; Please help me to seek Your guidance and Your strong hand every day.&nbsp; Amen.&nbsp;</p>

      <title>Even the Small Things</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2019/9/24/even-the-small-things</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading: </strong>"<em>So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.</em>" (1 Corinthians 10:31 NIV)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One of my favorite things about this scripture is the emphasis on <strong>all</strong>. It doesn’t say <em>some</em> or <em>a few</em>, but <strong>all</strong>. This is such a sweet reminder to all of us that God cares about even the smallest of moments during our day.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As I prepare to kick off another school year, I’m often reminded of the many ways that small things matter. Students notice the high-fives given, the hugs during a rough day, and the waves they see as they board the busses in the afternoon. I used to overlook these moments, until I realized that these actions have a huge impact in the success of their daily routine. To some people, these small gestures may be insignificant. But, to the students, they make a world of difference during their day.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the same way that teachers and staff focus on doing the small things to brighten a child’s day, our Father in heaven loves to see us give that same care and diligence to our actions. I love that this scripture mentions eating, drinking, and whatever we do throughout our day. It led me to think: How often do I work to honor God with everything I do? Do I take time to pause throughout the day and check my own actions and attitude?&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection:</strong> Think about your daily routine. How do you honor God in what you do? What moments can you examine more closely, so they bring God glory?&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer:</strong> God, I am so thankful for each day you give to me. Thank you for the reminder that you care about even the smallest of actions that I take. Continue to guide me, so that every part of my day brings glory to you.&nbsp; Help me to walk with you, hear your voice, and let my actions reflect your work in my life. Amen.&nbsp;</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Unseen</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Behold, the eye of the Lord is on those who fear him,</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; on those who hope in his steadfast love,</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>&nbsp;that he may deliver their soul from death</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; and keep them alive in famine.”</em> <strong>(Psalm 33:18-19 ESV)</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Daddy, look at me!” my sweet toddler says as she hangs from our living room chair. There is sheer joy on her face when she knows I’m watching. But I also notice the anxiety she feels when she thinks I don’t see her. There have been times on the playground or playing around the house when she runs into trouble and needs my help, but panic fills her heart and worry floods over her face as she frantically searches for me before I softly remind her, “I’m right here.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m not a toddler anymore and I have realized hard human realities like the fading applause, the end of a season, or abandonment. These cold feelings can lead to wondering “Does anyone really see me? Do I matter? As adults, we can sometimes find ourselves demanding God’s attention, “Daddy, look at me! Do you see me here? Do you see what I’m dealing with here? Do you even care?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you’ve felt like a shadow in a crowd or invisible to someone or everyone, the hope we have in Jesus is that God does see us.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Adrian Rogers captures this truth well in such distinct language.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>He’s up there on the mountain looking down. He sees right through the dark. You can’t see Him, but He sees you. […] And that thing that looks like it’s going to be over your head is already under His feet.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God sees you right where you are, even if no one else does. You don’t have to demand God’s attention. You already have it. When your hope is in His steadfast love, there is peace in the words, “I’m right here.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Considering how God sees you, take a moment and think about how he feels about you. After you’ve reminded yourself of His overwhelming compassion, ask yourself, “If God sees me, how do I see God?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God, thank you for seeing me when it feels like no one else does. Thank you for not only knowing what I’m going through but caring for me enough to help me through it and overcome it. Help me to see you more clearly and help me to see how you are working in my circumstances. In Jesus’ name…&nbsp;</p>

      <title>What Will Jesus Find?</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2020/11/11/whatwilljesusfind</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>"May no one ever eat fruit from you again."</em> (Mark 11:14) Jesus said this to a lone fig tree near the road he and his disciples&nbsp;were travelling. Imagining myself in the scene, I fear I would have been that impulsive disciple piping up with, "Lord, that’s pretty harsh!” Was Jesus truly angry that a tree did not produce fruit out of season?<br><br>Although Jesus was fully human, He was also fully God. God who is slow to anger. We can be certain that any frustration&nbsp;with this verse is due to our limited knowledge, not the nature of Jesus Christ.<br><br>The details in Mark 11:12-14 lead us to better understand what Jesus was saying. Scripture says it was <em>"a fig tree in leaf"</em> and <em>"that he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs."</em>&nbsp;(vv. 12-13)&nbsp;<br><br>As leaves start to unfurl on fig trees, little knobs also form. They drop from the tree prior to the figs’ fruition. These were a favorite source of food for travelers of Jesus' time. You can picture a single fig tree on the horizon full of bright green leaves and the promise of a delicious snack. <br><br>The fact that there were no knobs on this beckoning tree shows it was unhealthy and perhaps dying regardless of how it looked on the outside. Jesus was simply declaring the obvious.&nbsp;He was using this fig tree as an illustration to confront his disciples - and still does.<br>Keep in mind this occurs just before Jesus enters the temple to clear it. Standing in the Court of the Gentiles, where people from all nations worshiped God, Jesus finds hundreds of people making business transactions and busy with religiosity.&nbsp;<br><br>Jesus drove out these hypocrites flipping over their tables and chairs. He even stopped them from taking irreverent shortcuts through the temple. He then boldly taught from the prophet Isaiah who said,&nbsp;<em>“And&nbsp;the foreigners who join themselves to the&nbsp;Lord,&nbsp;to minister to him, to love the name of the&nbsp;Lord,&nbsp;and to be his servants,&nbsp;everyone&nbsp;who keeps the Sabbath and does not profane it,&nbsp;and holds fast my covenant —&nbsp;these I will bring to&nbsp;my holy mountain,&nbsp;and make them joyful in my house of prayer;&nbsp;their burnt offerings and their sacrifices&nbsp;will be accepted on my altar;&nbsp; for &nbsp; my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples .”</em> (Isaiah 65:6-7)<br><br>Like the fig tree, Jesus found no spiritual fruit in the temple. It was full of religious people taking their work and busyness very seriously; however, people intimate with God were not found. The people of God looked as though they were in full bloom, but they were not fulfilling their purpose.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>It is a tremendous thought that if you trust Jesus Christ as Savior, you are now "a temple of the Holy Spirit." (1 Corinthians 6:19) He lives in you. </em></p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Having been grafted to Christ, He has made a way to bear much fruit through you. You can now be a healthy branch abiding in God. <em>"This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples." </em>(John 15:8)<br><br>Realize that God longs for you to share the fruit of being in relationship with Him. Jesus Christ <br>strategically chose you to reveal Him at this time! (John 15:16) The Holy Spirit equips and empowers you to yield fruit that will feed your generation. What will Jesus find when he looks at your life?<br><br>Prayer:<br>Heavenly Father, thank You for drawing me near through Your Son Jesus Christ. I want to be closer to You, Lord. Please bear Your fruit and be revealed through my life. Amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading: </strong>“Give thanks in every circumstance, for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.” Philippians 4:4</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Are we there yet?”&nbsp;&nbsp;What parents haven’t heard these back-seat words and breathed a thankful sigh of relief when they finally got “there?”&nbsp;Unfortunately, with the focus on getting “there,” we often miss the “here” - the beautiful scenery of a side trip; funny, out-of-tune road trip songs; or indulgent travel snacks!&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;Well, here we are in November, 2020… it’s been quite a trip, to say the least! But are we there yet? Have we breathed that thankful sigh?&nbsp;Will we be thankful only when it’s over, or is it possible to be thankful along the way?&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We may not be “there,” but we can be “here,” for the moments of joy in this journey; maybe not thankful FOR the circumstances, but thankful IN the circumstances. We can embrace the side trip, the out-of-tune, the indulgences - even pajama pants - with thanks!&nbsp;We can, as James admonished, “count it all joy” when we face difficult times.&nbsp;We can, as Paul told the Philippians, “Give thanks in every circumstance, for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.” We can, with Peter, “greatly rejoice, though now for a little while (we) may have had to suffer…”&nbsp;These aren’t suggestions; they are charges given because God wants His very best for us, which is more of Him. We will face trials - that’s a given.&nbsp;Managing those trials positively and in tandem with God brings such intimacy with Him, an intimacy that outweighs those trials and ushers in joy, gratitude, hope, and thanksgiving as we motor through the mucky roads.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Often, it’s only in hindsight that we view trying times with thanksgiving... that illness, that betrayal, that loss, that financial distress, that pandemic, that ______ (fill in the blank!)&nbsp;I’ve heard we shouldn’t look back if we’re to move forward, but there is much to be learned from a backward glance, especially when our rear-view mirror reveals just how God moved! In the midst, though, we need the reminder to “give thanks IN every circumstance.” This shifts our focus to God’s working IN the situation - and IN us - DURING the crisis.&nbsp;We may not&nbsp;<em>see</em>His working; we may not&nbsp;<em>feel</em>His working.&nbsp;But accumulating hindsight experiences - instances that verify He always, always comes through, even if He comes through differently than we’d hoped - proves we can trust Him to come through again, and again, and again... and we can be thankful. Confidently, genuinely thankful.&nbsp;A God-honoring thankfulness that brings peace and focus to our situation through knowing, really knowing, that He is in control, that He will “Romans 8:28” any situation, because He’s “Romans 8:28-ed” every situation in the past. It’s that “knowing” that gives us courage to be thankful IN difficult situations, not just when we look at the road behind us. Thankful for His grace and mercy. Thankful that He is with us.&nbsp;Thankful that He wants His best for us. Thankful that He gives direction. Thankful that He provides.&nbsp;Thankful that He is faithful.&nbsp;Just thankful...for Him!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>“<em>Thank you, Lord, that you can be trusted in every situation. Thank you for your sacrifice, your faithfulness, your great love for us, and the intimacy you desire to have with us. Thank you for using difficulties to draw us into that amazing intimacy with you. Thank you that your Holy Spirit directs, comforts, advocates, and produces the fruits of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control in our lives, often through the challenging roads we traverse. Remind us, Lord, to be thankful in all circumstances...thankful for your pardon, your presence, your perfection, your power, your provision, your preparation, and your peace. Help us always to “Consider it pure joy, whenever we face trials of many kinds, because we know that the testing of our faith produces perseverance.&nbsp;Let perseverance finish its work so that we may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.” </em></strong><em>(from James 1:2-4)</em></p>

      <title>God's Power in Weakness</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2020/11/4/gods-power-in-weakness</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading: </strong>“Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;2 Corinthians 12:7-10 </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Is there anything more countercultural than boasting about your weaknesses? I mean, who does that? Certainly not many people I know. When I reflect on my life, I can think of plenty of times I’ve boasted about something, but I’ve rarely boasted about my weaknesses. I’ve tried to stay humble, but pride is always lurking in the shadows. Pride is something I think all of us have dealt with in our lives and it was no different with Paul. From these few verses, we can learn how God perfectly balances burdens and blessings. Paul came to understand that even a thorn in the flesh can be a gift because it helped him remain humble and completely dependent on God.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">About 20 years ago, God, in His grace and mercy, allowed some very hard things to come into our lives. First, my wife, Mona, got sick. She developed chronic fatigue and chronic pain that completely debilitated her. A few years later, our son starting struggling with drugs. Our life was a mess, but we started to get a glimpse of what Paul learned – that God’s grace is sufficient. We were blessed to be involved with community groups at The Point and I had the privilege of leading a co-ed group and later a men’s group. It was through this time in community that I learned what God can do with weakness because that’s all I could offer Him. I prepared, showed up and poured my heart out in group, but it was the Holy Spirit who did the heavy lifting. Paul said he gladly boasted about his weaknesses so that Christ’s power would rest on him. I would’ve never understood this unless I lived it. I’ve witnessed how God supernaturally brings beauty out of ashes and how He produces fruit out of the most unlikely of circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Years ago, I learned an acrostic for the word grace: God’s Riches Available at Christ’s Expense. God gave Paul and us a message of grace – sufficient grace and strengthening grace. God’s grace has saved and continues to save us from our sins, provides for our every need and gives us strength when we are weak.&nbsp;Paul didn’t place his trust in people or in his circumstances. He knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that God loved him even though he dealt with a persistent “thorn in his flesh”. We don’t know what the thorn was, but we can all relate to some kind of challenging issue in our lives.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So how does this translate to our lives right now? Do we have access to God’s “sufficient grace”? Absolutely! We present our weakness to God and He gives us His strength. When do we do this? Everyday. How do we do this? We spend time with our Lord each day in prayer and Bible reading. We join a community group where we can grow, serve and become spiritually mature. What will be the result? Our self-centeredness and pride will be replaced with a dependence on God and He will begin to transform us into men and women who reflect His image. We will bear fruit that lasts and we will bring honor and glory to Jesus, our faithful and gracious Lord and King.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>“Heavenly Father, you are so good and faithful and patient with us. You know our struggle with pride and how we’re prone to try to do things in our own strength. Thank you for allowing the thorns of life which reveal our weaknesses and teach us to rely on your infinite strength rather than our own. Thank you for your grace which is sufficient for our every need. We love you Lord and it’s in the Name of Jesus we pray. Amen!”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</strong></p>

      <title>Planning for the Unexpected</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2020/11/4/planning-for-the-unexpected</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading:&nbsp;</strong>“Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the LORD that will stand.” Proverbs 19:21 (ESV)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I recently saw a post that said, “Can we all agree that in 2015 not a single person got the answer correct to&nbsp;<em>where do you see yourself five years from now</em>?” So true. Who would’ve imagined we’d be living through a global pandemic with continuous uncertainty about the future. Definitely not me!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am a planner. I always feel better when plans are set and feel settled when I know what is coming. During this pandemic, planning has been ridiculously hard. There are so many unknowns. There are plans we had set over these past 5 months that were cancelled. Family gatherings. Celebrations. Camps. Trips. My daughter was recently excitedly shopping for her dorm and we were making travel arrangements when her school suddenly announced the dorms would not open - after assigning her a room number and move-in date. Plans upended. My son has been so excited to start high school and play football this fall. But as of now football is cancelled, and he is starting high school virtually. These are just a few examples of how unpredictable life has been during this time of COVID in my family. I’m sure we can all relate and have many examples of plans changing these past 5 months.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When our plans get disrupted, it is easy to feel overcome with worry and burdened with the weight of all these disruptions and unknowns.&nbsp;God never intended for us to carry these burdens alone. He has also shown time and time again that we don’t need to know exactly HOW he is going to carry out His plans, we just need to TRUST that He is at work and that He is GOOD.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In this season of unknowns. I am learning the freedom of leaning into God, and the reality that His plans are always greater than mine. So I can rest in the reality that whatever it is, God’s got it. When wrestling with uncertainty, there are a few steps that can help align our hearts with this reality.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1) <strong>Go to the Word</strong>. Search for Scripture to meditate on that which speaks to what is on your heart. Write it on a sticky note and put it around your house. You can even set a reminder on your phone with that verse in it, so that you are reading it throughout the day, no matter how busy you may be. This helps me focus on God rather than circumstances.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2) &nbsp;<strong>Seek the Lord in prayer.</strong>I love the verse,&nbsp;<em>From the end of the earth I will cry to You, When my heart is overwhelmed; Lead me to the rock that is higher than I</em>. -Psalm 61:2 NKJV. We don’t need to rely on our own strength, our own abilities, or our own plans. When we don’t look to God first, it is easy to feel overwhelmed and consumed with worry or fear, especially in this season. But when we feel this way we can cry out to God for peace, clarity, strength, help, hope, healing, and so much more.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">3) As Pastor Gabe has been encouraging us to do,&nbsp;<strong>Take One Day at a Time</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t get caught up in “what ifs” in the midst of this pandemic.&nbsp;I love this verse from the Passion Translation-&nbsp;<em>Refuse to worry about tomorrow, but deal with each challenge that comes your way, one day at a time. Tomorrow will take care of itself</em>. - Matthew 6:34&nbsp;&nbsp;We don’t need to worry about the coming months, we can focus on Jesus today, and then tomorrow, we can do the same thing.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">4)&nbsp;<strong>Focus on Gratitude.&nbsp;</strong>When we are thankful for what we have, it is hard to focus on what we don’t have in this season. It always helps me to make a gratitude list when I’m feeling discouraged. Seeing all that God has already blessed us with is a good reminder that He always comes through for us.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">5)&nbsp;<strong>Rest. </strong>When we cast our cares on God, He assures us that we will find rest for our souls. Romans 8:28 reminds us that God is working all things together for our good. Jeremiah 29:11 tells us God’s plans for us are for our wellbeing, to give us hope and a future. We can have peace regardless of the circumstances in the world when we rest in the reality that God is always at work, and His plans are always good. He is FOR US.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>“Heavenly Father, we thank you for your love and goodness. We thank you that You are at work in our lives right now, and that Your plans are good. Help us to trust You with all our hearts, and give us peace as we seek You daily. We love you and praise you, in Jesus’ name. Amen.”</em></strong></p>

      <title>The Power of Being Thankful</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2020/11/4/the-power-of-being-thankful</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Readings:&nbsp;</strong>“But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come: For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents,&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration:underline">unthankful</span>, unholy…” (2 Tim. 3:1-2)&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“My soul, praise the LORD, and do not forget all His benefits.” (Psalm 103:2)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Billy Graham said, “Even when life may be difficult, we should thank God for all He does for us – which we do not deserve.” We know too well how difficult days provide ample opportunity to overlook God’s generosity.&nbsp;If concerns become the track our minds ride day after day, news cycle after news cycle, it’s near impossible to shift direction. In fact, our fear and pride direct that very train of thought.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In his letter to Timothy, Paul shares that people will grow increasingly unthankful in the darkest of days. Like an expert marksman, he nails what is common to all of us – forgetfulness of God’s perfect gifts. Wouldn’t you agree it’s hard to be thankful for something you don’t remember? As a result, this habit of fretting and forgetting fills our souls with darkness. Scripture encourages us to push against these run-away thoughts by remembering God’s goodness.&nbsp;<em>“I will give&nbsp;</em><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>thanks</em></span><em> to the LORD with my whole heart; I will&nbsp;</em><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>recount</em></span><em> all of your wonderful deeds.” </em>(Psalm 9:1) Remembering captivates our hearts with thankfulness and joy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As we celebrate with thanksgiving this season, intentionally recall and notice God’s goodness toward you. One simple way is to pay attention to the details of your moments.&nbsp;<em>“Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.” </em>(James 1:17) Every moment can be an encounter with God’s goodness. Beauty, ability, provision, any sense of peace and security, any encouragement or glimmer of the Lord Jesus Christ’s character is a good gift meant for you and worthy of recognition. When you thank God anxiety diminishes, discontent decreases, and the presence of the Holy Spirit is evident; not to mention the energizing effect gratitude has on those around us.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In closing, be encouraged by the gorgeous truth that generosity is an unchangeable trait of your Heavenly Father. He will always give you good gifts. You will always have thanks to give Him. Remembering God’s blessings and having a thankful heart will bring light to your darkest days.&nbsp;<em>“It is good to give thanks to the LORD…” </em>(Ps. 92:1a)&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>“Heavenly Father, thank You for Your generosity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please help me to remember Your constant goodness. I’m so thankful to be the recipient of Your good gifts. It is in Jesus Christ’s generously given name that I pray. Amen.”</em></strong></p>

      <title>Such an Awesome Thing</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2020/12/22/such-an-awesome-thing</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading:</strong> Now My soul has become troubled; and what shall I say, “Father, save Me from this hour?”&nbsp; But for this purpose I came to this hour. John 12:27</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>Little boy asleep on a manger bed,</em></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>Do I see a crown on your tiny head?</em></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>I know this cannot be, yet in my heart I see</em></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>Such an awesome thing – I can see a king.</em></p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>Little baby safe in your mother’s arms,</em></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>What is this you’re wearing to keep you warm?</em></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>A purple robe I see; you’re clothed in majesty.</em></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>Such an awesome thing – you are born a king.</em></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>Little son of Mary, how can this be?</em></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>Three wise kings have come very far to see</em></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>The one who from his birth is Lord of all the earth.</em></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>Such an awesome thing – you are king of kings.</em></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>Little child, so peaceful and unaware,</em></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>There’s a crown of sorrow that you must wear.</em></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>Yet in your eyes I see your wondrous love for me.</em></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>Such an awesome thing – you will be my king.&nbsp;</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I first wrote these words they were set to music, sort of a Christmas lullaby, but even without the melody or the gentle rhythm, they speak to the wonder and majesty of the Christ child. How we love to linger in the warm glow of the manger scene, but we cannot stay there.&nbsp;We must also remember why it was that Jesus came to be born on that first Christmas night. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The gospel of Luke tells us that Simeon immediately recognized the infant Messiah when He was brought into the temple, and by the power of the Holy Spirit began to prophesy regarding Him.&nbsp;His eyes beheld a baby, but His heart saw the Savior of the world; a light of revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of God’s chosen people. But Simeon saw something more, for he then turned to Mary and said, “Behold, this Child is appointed for the fall and rise of many in Israel . . . and a sword will pierce even your own soul.” He saw the Savior of the world in all His glory and honor, while also seeing the “crown of sorrow” that Jesus was destined to wear.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is good for us to delight in the warm glow of our decorations, gifts, carols and candles this Christmas, but as we do so, let’s not forget the Jesus who was born of a virgin and came into our world for a purpose – to humble Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross – and to become our king, our Savior and our Lord.&nbsp;O come let us adore Him!&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>“Father, open our eyes, I pray, to see the wondrous love you have for us in sending Jesus to be our Savior.&nbsp;Thank you for that love and grace that was poured out on the cross, and may we ever live to worship you and adore our heavenly king.&nbsp;Amen.”</em></strong></p>

      <title>Your “Yes” Could Change Lives</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2020/12/7/your-yes-could-change-lives</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As Christmas is near and we are thinking about the birth of Jesus, I want to bring our attention for a moment to Mary, his mother and the hardest “yes” she ever had to answer. Let’s step back and remember the huge step of faith Mary took those many years ago.&nbsp; </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Most young girls at that time and in that area of the world were betrothed/engaged at around 11 or 12 years of age; and generally, to an 18-year-old who now would be able to have a job and take care of a family.&nbsp;In the Eastern world if you were 13 and not married, you were like what we think of as an old maid.&nbsp; </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Mary was engaged to Joseph, still living with her family.&nbsp;But the day the angel Gabriel appeared to her, changed her life and the world forever.&nbsp;Mary woke up on a typical day, perhaps doing her chores or visiting with family and friends, not even imaging what would come that day.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I think of all that Luke 1 says……. all Mary heard from the angel Gabriel:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1 – You have found favor with God. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2 – You will conceive and give birth to a son.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">3 – You will call him Jesus.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">4 – He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High.&nbsp; </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">5 - He will be given the throne of his father, David, </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">6 – He will reign over Jacob’s descendants forever and ever. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">7 – His kingdom will never end.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Can you even imagine all the thoughts Mary had after hearing this news?&nbsp;Some of which I am sure were that people might not believe her, perhaps even some in her own family. In that time if you were found to be pregnant outside of wedlock you were often times killed.&nbsp;Historically and culturally, it was an honor/shame world in which they lived. Yet her love and trust for God allowed her to say the hard “yes”.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sometimes the holiest things we are called to do may be the very hardest.&nbsp;Mary had no idea what this may have cost – for herself, Joseph, her family, her village.&nbsp;Yet she trusted and obeyed and said yes.&nbsp; </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>&nbsp;“And Mary said, “Behold, the Lord’s bond-servant; may it be done to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.“ Luke 1:38<em>.</em></strong>&nbsp;I love this verse.&nbsp;May we all have a heart that agrees – “may it be done to me according to your word”.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When was the last time you had a hard “yes” to answer to the Lord?&nbsp;Were you able to answer yes? The only way we are able to answer yes is to be so close that we can hear Him and know Him deeply. Don’t allow fear to overshow what God has for you. God gave us spiritual gifts and wants us to use them.&nbsp;He will always enable these gifts to be utilized for both the benefit of others and His glory.&nbsp; </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As we celebrate the birth of our Savior this year, let us not forget to be listening to His voice.&nbsp; Always being available to say “yes” as He calls us to join him.&nbsp; </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>“Father, thank you for the greatest gift of your son, let us not take it lightly or for granted.&nbsp;Give us the desire to continue our walk and grow closer each day to always be available to say yes when you ask.&nbsp;Our heart’s desire is to be available at any given moment.&nbsp;&nbsp; May your will be done in all things. In Jesus name, Amen.”</em></strong></p>

      <title>Act Like Men</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading: &nbsp;</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>“</strong>Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, <strong>act like men</strong>, be strong.&nbsp; Let all that you do be done in love.”&nbsp; (1 Cor. 16:13-14)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What is a man?&nbsp; In some cultures, boys go with men to the woods, bang on logs, whoop and holler, hear traditional stories, endure painful stuff, and come back men for life with all its rights, privileges, and responsibilities.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Generally, not so in our culture.&nbsp; It seems more of a blur, like a camera that hasn’t found a sharp focus.&nbsp; I even wondered at times, age 30 with a wife and two small children, “Am I a man yet?”&nbsp; (Now I’m a recovering parent of teenagers—20 years after; and yes, I’ve long been a man.)&nbsp; At some point, boys want to be regarded, treated, and respected as men.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In today’s culture, though, being a guy can be tough.&nbsp; Men are routinely dissed and kicked to the curb.&nbsp; Boys are “trouble” in school.&nbsp; Some people focus on guys through a tiny coffee straw looking for the worst behavior.&nbsp; There’s that, no doubt.&nbsp; All men are sinners; some sin beyond all limits.&nbsp; But a wider view also finds men of noble character—wise, intelligent, courageous, strong, kind, gentle, loving, trustworthy, protectors of the weak, advocates for the innocent, second chance givers, “no nonsense” disciplinarians, mentors—in short, the kind of men that women, children, and other men need.&nbsp; If you look hard enough for something, you’ll find it, some say.&nbsp; It’s true.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In February, scores of men spent most of a Saturday at The Point VA’s first Men’s Conference.&nbsp; We guys are sinners saved by God’s grace.&nbsp; Rather than denying, hiding, or making excuses for sinful, even shameful behavior, some guys stood before all the rest and shared their amazing testimonies of transformation—how God made them new creatures in Christ—turning them from sinful, hurtful behavior to becoming men that others can respect and admire, men to whom others can point and say to their sons, “I want you to be like them, to become what they’ve become.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Corinthian church was rife with problems. &nbsp; “Paul the man” made a permanent, God-inspired record of those problems as he tackled them in apostolic fashion.&nbsp; In the closing chapter, he exhorts, <em>“Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, </em><strong><em>act</em></strong><em> </em><strong><em>like</em></strong><em> </em><strong><em>men</em></strong><em>, be strong.&nbsp; </em><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>Let all that you do be done in love</em>.</span>”&nbsp; If history and current events teach men anything, they teach us not to take our cues from contemporary culture.&nbsp; Scripture abounds with timeless qualities of God’s man.&nbsp; Why not put these two verses to memory and make it your habit to find, remember, and practice qualities of character and descriptors of thought and behavior that can be discovered by any man seeking them?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Dear Father, thank You for making me a man and assigning me days to live on Your earth for Your good purpose and glory.&nbsp; Please open my eyes to see what it means to be a man of God, empower me by your Spirit to become that man, and grant me the wisdom, strength, and courage to be that man all my remaining days.&nbsp; Amen.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Scripture Reading</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>&nbsp; </strong>“This is the day the Lord has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.” (Ps. 118.24 NKJV)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This verse in Psalm 118 is one of my favorites.&nbsp; For me, this simple verse sums up everything I know and believe in my walk with our Lord.&nbsp; HE is the one in charge.&nbsp; HE gives us the gift of life and gives us grace each day - grace that we can’t even comprehend.&nbsp; During the last 2 months I have seen the wonder of this verse in a very beautiful way.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On January 5th, 2020 one of my friends suffered a brain aneurism or brain bleed that left her in a coma with a very dire prognosis.&nbsp; For several days after the initial trauma she continued to suffer additional bleeding and brain damage. &nbsp; Her family was devastated, terrified, exhausted and humbled by their inability to do anything but watch as the medical experts and care team worked day and night to help her survive.&nbsp; She spent weeks in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and was moved to a Stepdown Unit while still in a coma.&nbsp; Their family was strong in faith and called on the Lord frequently to get them through the minutes, hours and days, praying for a miracle.&nbsp; From the hospital they sent out pleas for prayer, prayed literally without ceasing and I often saw them circling her bed with heads bowed.&nbsp; They prayed for their own patience as they longed to have their wife, sister, mom and Gigi back within the arms of their family.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What I saw from the outside was an incredible strength emerge through the power of their prayers. &nbsp; I saw a beautiful love story unfolding.&nbsp; Her family and friends formed a system to make sure she had 24-hour companionship.&nbsp; Her husband reminded us that whatever happened, God was the one in control and God should be the one given glory for the gift of her life over the years and their marriage.&nbsp; I saw Psalm 118:24 being lived out every day as they reminisced and rejoiced in her life lived and were so grateful for each additional day. &nbsp; As the weeks wore on the family continued their watch and their wait, and they prayed.&nbsp; Her daughters grieved but tried to remain patient.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Matthew 11: 28-30 – “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.&nbsp; For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”&nbsp; On her 70th birthday she was moved to a rehabilitation center.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After her move to the rehab center little things started to happen.&nbsp; She wiggled her toes.&nbsp; She moved her left hand for the first time.&nbsp; She smiled.&nbsp; When her daughters came to visit, she seemed to track their movement with her eyes.&nbsp; They continued to pray.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This last week, she was able to mouth her name when asked by a therapist and take sips of water. &nbsp; Towards the end of the week she mouthed the words, “I love you” to her husband and reached for his arm.&nbsp; To the family this was their miracle that only God could have done, and I am once again reminded that each day is an incredible gift and we should rejoice and be glad in the love of our Heavenly Father.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear Heavenly Father, thank you so much for this day and the beauty that comes with it.&nbsp; We are so grateful for you and for your healing and for the lessons of love that you teach us through all kinds of situations.&nbsp; We are humbled by your power and your grace and we honor you above all things.&nbsp; In your precious name we pray, AMEN. </p>

      <title>Searching for Love in All The Wrong Places</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2020/3/30/searching-for-love-in-all-the-wrong-places</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Readings:&nbsp; <br>1 John 4: 16-</strong> We have come to know [by personal observation and experience], and have believed [with deep, consistent faith] the love which God has for us. <strong>God is love</strong>, and the one who abides in love, abides in God, and God abides continually in him. (I love the amplified version when I am studying because it helps me really see and understand some of the hidden meaning of the words that might get lost in translation.)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Exodus 20: 2-3</strong>- I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. You shall have no other gods before me.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Psalm 103: 2, 4</strong>- Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits… who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My personal experience with God has stretched over years at this point. The marvelous thing is that it never gets old and He guides our relationship deeper and deeper from one experience to another as I place my trust in Him more with each passing year and phase of life. When I was younger, I thought a person would fulfill my need for love. As a child it was my dad, as a young woman, my husband. These two men are such great influences on my life and I am grateful God gave them to me; but as I live and learn, I realize the God shaped vacuum in my heart is too big for them to fill and too powerful for me to ignore the real Father and lover of my soul who desires to fill that space.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I also think that our society throws the word “love” around all too casually. We can talk about loving chocolate and family in the same breath. One way that I see love exercised is with trust. Can we trust that thing we love to bring us joy, happiness, restoration, life? Is that thing or person trustworthy? Putting too much value on anything outside of God cannot fill that place of longing in our hearts. For a while, I think I even tried looking for love from my career. Thinking it made me more of a person, more worthy or worthwhile somehow. As a nurse I gained a lot of my sense of worth from helping people. I thought I was in the right place. Turns out I was wrong.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God relocated my husband and me here to Virginia just over a year ago. The uprooting I felt made me again realize I was searching in wrong places. Out of a sense of longing for a grandchild we answered the call to help in Kidspoint. How blessed we have been to be preparing to be grandparents while loving the kids here in our new community! Even being a grandparent will not fulfill our deep need for love.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I feel a little like Dorothy in Oz. I am not in Kansas, never was. But I always had the power to return home, if that return was to God. He empowers me every day to seek Him first, put Him first and to trust Him in all things. I can try to search my own way and get lost in the process. Or, I can trust Him to draw me to His perfect love and plan for my life.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer:<br></strong>Father God, you are love. You set me free from a life of slavery. I am so grateful for the people and places you have put in my life that point the way to you. I am thankful for your equipping me to touch peoples’ lives in my career and family. Help me to always abide in you and lean on you and your ways for understanding. Let me not get distracted by the good things you give to me as benefits. Help me to always put you first. Amen.</p>

      <title>For Such a Time as This</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2020/3/31/for-such-a-time-as-this</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading:</strong> <br> “Who knows but that you have come to royal position for such a time as this?” (Esther 4: 14b).&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Loss. Fear. Loneliness. These are a few of the emotions that come to mind as I ponder the ramifications that the coronavirus has had on my life and the lives of my friends and family. Some of you reading this may have lost your jobs, or even loved ones as a result of the virus. I often allow myself to become fearful considering the toll this disease has taken on our healthcare system, or how it may affect my parents. Finally, the loneliness related to social distancing seems unbearable some days, even for an introvert like myself.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In all of this COVID-19 chaos, the Lord has been comforting me through the character of Esther. A Jewish girl who lived in Persia during the reign of King Xerxes, Esther’s life suddenly changed due to circumstances completely beyond her control; she was brought to the royal palace to become part of King Xerxes’s harem. Like us, Esther experienced loss, fear, and loneliness as her friends were probably not as accessible and her religious customs were seemingly obliterated. In addition to all of Esther’s personal fears, her people, the Jews, were to be terminated by Haman, a noble in service of King Xerxes. Esther was faced with a grim ultimatum: she could watch her people be executed while she kept silent, or she could risk her life by going to the king without an invitation to plead for the lives of her people. As Esther labored in her decision, her cousin, Mordecai, posed the question, “Who knows but that you have come to royal position for such a time as this?” (Esther 4:14b).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Though the words of Mordecai were applied to Esther during a specific time in history, I believe that we too have been placed in this frightening, foreign time “for such a time as this.” In His omniscience, the Lord knew the time and dates that COVID-19 would occur, and in His wisdom has perfectly placed us in the middle of it to “shine as stars in the sky, blameless and pure” (Philippians 2:15). Let us not lose hope, brothers and sisters. I don’t know what the Lord has in store for us in our version of Esther’s story, but what I do know is that He has given us the opportunity to join Him in saving His people . . . our friends and neighbors who need a Savior, just like the Jews in Esther’s story.&nbsp; “Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season, we will reap a harvest if we do not give up” (Galatians 6:9). &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer:<br></strong>Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, let me be like Esther, making the decision to cast fear aside and look to you though she did not know the outcome. Give us faith to help save your people in “such a time as this.”&nbsp;</p>

      <title>His Great Faithfulness</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading:</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> “The Lord’s mercies indeed never cease, for His compassions never fail.&nbsp; They are new every morning; great is Thy faithfulness.”&nbsp; (Lamentations 3:22-23)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“All my life You have been faithful; all my life You have been so, so good.”</em>&nbsp; Whenever we sing this powerful chorus in our church, my eyes inevitably begin to fill with tears!&nbsp; Does this ever happen to you during worship?&nbsp; Lately I began to wonder, “Why does this happen, what are these tears all about?”&nbsp; So I asked God to help me find out.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To begin with, God’s faithfulness is part of His character.&nbsp; He must be true to His nature, and does not change.&nbsp; This is why He is known in both the Old and New Testaments as a covenant keeping God.&nbsp; In Deuteronomy 7:9 He is “God, the faithful God, who keeps His covenant to a thousandth generation;” and in Luke 22:20, Jesus told His disciples, “This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in My blood.”&nbsp; Yes, God is truly and forever faithful – hallelujah! – but I found there was more to my tears than that.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I found that even in a church full of worshiping people, when I sing those words, it’s just between God and me.&nbsp; It’s deeply personal.&nbsp; “I’ve known Him as a father and I’ve known Him as a friend.”&nbsp; Lord, all MY life You have been faithful; all MY life you have been so, so good!&nbsp; All my life . . . and this begs the question: What about that life?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Truth be told, I’ve not always been faithful to God, but in those times, He was still faithful to me.&nbsp; The years I spent in rebellion and going my own way like a blinded, lost sheep, He was faithful.&nbsp; The days I spent ignoring Him and reaching out for whatever pleased me, He was faithful.&nbsp; Through every doubt and every fear, every willful sin and unrepentant moment, He was faithful.&nbsp; And every time I returned to Him, He was waiting for me with open arms and received me again in faithfulness, mercy and forgiveness.&nbsp; What magnanimous love!&nbsp; What undeserved goodness!&nbsp; O to know that His unfailing grace is mine, mine for all my life and for all eternity! &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And so I stand and sing, hands raised, heart lifted up, lost in overwhelming gratitude and inexpressible love for Him, my wonderful God.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Has God been faithful to you?&nbsp; As we look back and recall His goodness throughout the years of our lives, our suitable and fitting response is to worship Him.&nbsp; Spend some time today in worship, just remind yourself and refresh yourself as to His nature, character, and faithfulness, remembering all He’s done for you and how very much He loves you.&nbsp; Only a simple, thankful heart is required – tissues are optional!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer:</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">O Lord, please accept my prayer of gratitude and thanks for who you are and all you’ve done for me.&nbsp; I rejoice in your attributes and character, your perfect nature of love and grace.&nbsp; Thank you for creating me to be your child, and for your promise to always be with me.&nbsp; May all honor, glory, thanks and praise be yours from this time forth and forevermore. Amen.</p>

      <title>The Lord is Our Peace</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2020/3/31/the-lord-is-our-peace</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading:</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I WILL BE WITH YOU.”<strong>&nbsp; </strong>(Judges 6:16)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Billy Graham stated:&nbsp; “This is Peace--to be able to sleep in the storm! In Christ, we are relaxed and at peace in the midst of confusions, bewilderments, and perplexities of this life. The storm rages, but our hearts are at rest.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Scripture reminds us all of the story of Gideon and the anxiety he must have felt when God asked him to deliver the children of Israel. But the Lord spoke the words we all need to hear these words in Judges 6:16: "I will be with you!"</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With all that's happening daily, being self-employed and having employees that have been with me as long as 30 years, it is easier to invite something like worry or fear into your mindset. Some of these employees have become like family. God taught me years ago how to recognize and understand worry and fear as being incompatible with answered prayer. The enemy is a master at deceiving us all in very seductive ways. I pray we all put on the full armor of God – <em>first thing </em>every morning and then throughout the day.&nbsp; By doing this, we can recognize quicker and will be prepared to rebuke the enemy's attempts to instill worry or fear. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We all see and hear of new things daily that can cause fear and worry, knowing they are perhaps as threatening and unsettling as anything we’ve ever seen.&nbsp; That's what I love about God's living and breathed Word. We can feed on it like manna from heaven!! &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jeremiah 29:11-12 is a scripture passage we all know well, and yet every time I read it, I smile! “For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you.”&nbsp; Thank You Father God!&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer:</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father God, help us to keep our eyes fixed on Jesus each day as we walk and talk with the King of Kings.&nbsp; Thank you for Your Word and for the reassurance of its truth – for today and every day.&nbsp; May the promise of Your presence bring us peace as the storm rages, for in You our hearts find rest.</p>

      <title>Quarantine Encouragement From a Professional</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2020/4/22/quarantine-encouragement-from-a-professional</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Scripture Reading: “I am acting with great boldness toward you; I have great pride in you; I am filled with comfort. In all our affliction, I am overflowing with joy.” (2 Corinthians 7:4) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">These days it seems like you can’t avoid affliction, even when forced to shelter in place. With all the news, loneliness, and even tensions inside your own home it can be hard to find the joy. It’s important to be aware, be smart, be safe, and be kind (to yourself and others). These are tough times for all, but working together (even from afar) can be a huge help to everyone. I’m not a CDC or biblical expert, but I do know that being smart, considerate, and faithful will get us through this. And feeling panic, fear, concern, anxiety, etc. is normal and okay. God gave us feelings and common sense for a reason. God is in control. But it’s how we deal with it and treat ourselves and others that is in our control. Y’all can do it! So as someone who does social distancing for a living (thanks to a few chronic illnesses) I wanted to share some tips that can help you find some comfort, stability, and hopefully joy in this unknown time. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">-Keep with the daily hygiene and routine sleep schedule. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">-Stay hydrated. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">-Step outside/Get in the car and leave the house. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">-Put electronics on silence, it’s good to step away from all the news and alerts for some time. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">-Acknowledge what you’re grateful for daily. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">-Reach out to folks during this time/Join a small group via video chat. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">-Don’t do everything in one day...spread out your “to do” list throughout the week. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">-Now’s a good time to read a book, study a book of the bible, check out a podcast or a TV streaming service, etc. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">-Prayer, meditation, and yoga are helpful to slow down and relax the mind. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">-Foster an animal from the local shelter/offer to walk an elderly or sick person’s pup. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">-If everyone is healthy and safe, offer to help someone who may not be able to leave the house.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer: “Heavenly Father, we know that all things work together for your good. Help us to use this time of forced stillness to focus on you, how we can serve others, and the daily joy you continue to send every day that reminds us of your perfect love for us. And in these times where it’s hard to understand what’s going on and why, help us to cling to your peace that truly surpasses all understanding. We love you so much, Amen”.</p>

      <title>Listen to His Voice</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2020/5/20/listen-to-his-voice</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading: </strong>My child, we will go together, and I will be your Guide. I will be “the Light unto your feet and the Lamp unto your path.” (Psalm 119:105)</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A couple of days ago, my 3 year old son terrified my wife and me when he hopped on his little balance bike, locked his gaze on the horizon, and took off out of the driveway and down the street. Our 10 year old daughter and our 14 year old nephew had just left a few minutes prior on a bike ride, but they were well out of sight.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My 7 months pregnant wife was in no position to run after him, and she called out to him in vain as he blazed a trail into the sunset. I was outside at the time and heard the commotion, and a split second later I was tearing through the front yard, hot on his heels—or wheels.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I yelled at him to stop, some obvious desperation in my voice. But my voice fell on deaf ears as my determined little fellow only seemed to pick up speed as he rolled down the dangerous street.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Thankfully, there were no cars anywhere around on a road where the speed limit is 40 MPH. As I finally caught up to him, I could see the determined look in his eyes as his little legs pushed him further down the street.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I finally was able to run past him and stop him in his tracks. You know that moment, the overwhelming emotion running through you as you search for words? There I was, grabbing a firm hold of his handle bars as I jumped in front of his little blue bike.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Buddy, you can’t just go into the road without Momma or Daddy!! You have to have someone with you!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">His fists clenched around his little handlebars, his eyes filled with fury almost looking through me, his cheeks burning with anger, huge crocodile tears began to fall as he choked out, “You are BLOCKING my WAY!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I sat with him and talked with him for a minute, embracing him as he stood on his little balance bike on the side of the road.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I asked him if he wanted me to go with him so he could go for a bike ride, and through his tears he finally nodded yes. We took off down the road together, me running next to him as he continued his dire mission to find his sister and cousin, and join them.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Many times we take off on our own, without God. He pleads with us, even raises His voice at us, as we blaze further down the road away from Him. As we further recklessly endanger ourselves and push down our own path, He pursues us, ultimately jumping in front of us and stopping us in our tracks. We don’t understand, we clench our fists and burn with anger and confusion. WHY God?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have you ever heard His voice after you have taken off without Him? Have you ever looked back and seen how He had tried to stop you gently, tried to show you the way? Have you ever wished you had heeded God’s voice, and maybe the hardship and the destruction in your life could have been avoided?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Walk with the Lord and seek His guidance, and He will walk with you as you honor His will for your life.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer:&nbsp; </strong>Heavenly Father, guide my path as I walk with you daily.&nbsp; Help me to know Your will for my life.&nbsp; Amen. </p>

      <title>Gratitude in Times of Uncertainty</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2020/5/8/gratitude-in-times-of-uncertainty</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If there’s one thing I’ve learned in the past two months, it would have to be the hard lesson of being content in the here and now. I’m the OG of FOMO (fear of missing out) , and I tend to look backwards in regret and also forwards in anticipation. It breeds anxiety in my life, like major anxiety, and it’s something that I dealt with even as a child.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I can’t say I’ve eliminated any of it, or some magic stardust floated down and *poof* I’m cured, but this whole thing has caused me to slow my roll. Gratitude like every single day. Even the days that feel like everything is combusting.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I love this sacred space we’ve created as a family and that’s growing in me these past 8 weeks. Its something that has been missing in me for quite awhile, and I’m finding it again. This time has gone by so quickly, and it’s definitely not ending super fast...but life must move forward. Bit by bit we will leave the bunkers and embrace each other and exclaim, “We made it! We are the lucky ones.” I can say that I’m walking into it all changed, and um, maybe a bit raw? Aren’t we all? Yea, I think we’re all just tender right now.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I hope my girls look back one day and say, “We weren’t scared, but we were safe so that others could be safe. We were on top of each other’s personal space, and we fought like every day, but we grew closer than ever in love and understanding. Family walks, and birds building nests on our porch, learning how to bake, and mom teaching us subtraction and the art of handwritten letters, are things we want to pass on to our own families. We learned a lot about how God provides, and how blessed we are. We miss those quarantine days. They made us.”  💗</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lord, in a world of vast unknowns please remind us what it feels like to slow down and be in Your presence. When we truly appreciate the moment, the day, the very hour that you have given us, it changes our perspective. Holy Spirit move us to gratitude. Shift our hearts from fear and anxiety, to peace and gratefulness. We love you. We are so thankful to have gotten another day here, with those we love.</p>

      <title>Bigger Than I Thought You Were</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2020/6/17/bigger-than-i-thought-you-were</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> “Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise; His greatness no one can fathom.” – Psalm 145:3</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lately I’ve been thanking God that He is immeasurable and incomprehensible. He has no limits; He is unable to be fully known; He is an infinite mystery.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Earlier this year I suffered a serious injury that had me bedridden for weeks. I don’t know how I got hurt. The doctors don’t know how I got hurt. How can I literally not be able to stand up or drive or shower and no one know the cause?! Here’s the truth: God knows me full well. While the chiropractor, my parents and friends, and myself try to understand, God doesn’t try. He made me and He is intimately familiar with me. He knows exactly what went wrong and how it happened, and He knows exactly what I need to heal. While I am limited in my knowing, God is not. And this truth creates peace in my heart. I do not know myself fully nor can I, but I do know the one who knows me fully and He is good and He is trustworthy. So, in my limitedness I acknowledge and praise my limitless Papa.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To say I can know God fully would imply that He has limits and can be measured and that would somehow place God not above me, as He is, but beside me. It’s not that He isn’t able to be known but that He is so unlimited in Himself that it is impossible to know Him fully. All throughout the Bible, God consistently and constantly affirms He knows his creations better than we know ourselves. For example, God’s reply to Job in Job 38-41 and Jesus’ reply to the woman at the well in John 4. This vastness of God should cause us to tremble. But we can also find peace and assurance that God is fully good so all that we don’t know about Him is fully good too. God doesn’t have skeletons in His closet, but I guess if He did, they would only be good and pure and beautiful.&nbsp; </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For the past two years I have been asking God to <em>blow to my mind</em> and I find myself more and more these days praising Him, “Wow, God, You are so much bigger than I thought You were.” God wouldn’t be much of a “god” if we were able to mark his boundaries or if we could grasp all of who He is. God is so much bigger than we think and so much bigger than we know and that’s a good thing because it reminds us that He is God and we are not.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God who is immeasurable, You are more than I thought You were. You continually do things outside my imagination. Your ways are higher and Your thoughts are higher. Thank-you for your specific and complete care of me. You see me. You know me. Help me to think on You and of You rightly. Increase my faith that I might not underestimate You. Amen.</p>

      <title>It’s OK to not be OK</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2020/6/2/its-ok-to-not-be-ok</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading:&nbsp; </strong>“But he answered me, “My grace is always more than enough for you, and my power finds its full expression through your weakness.” So I will celebrate my weaknesses, for when I’m weak I sense more deeply the mighty power of Christ living in me.”&nbsp; 2 Corinthians 12:9</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sitting in my office on March 13, I watched, stunned, as the Governor closed all Virginia schools for two weeks, and I tried to wrap my brain around what the break from school would look like for me, my daughter, and my family.&nbsp; I wrote a schedule for our days: up and showered by 9, bible study together at the dining room table, English or Algebra work, exercise outside, and chores.&nbsp; There would be a family lunch, a break time, followed by more school.&nbsp; We would make dinner together, wind down for the evening, and go to bed by 10.&nbsp; I threw the schedule away by the second day. I think my early attempts at controlling the experience of pandemic for my family speaks to a greater faith issue I’ve uncovered in myself.&nbsp; I don’t trust God to be in control, so I try to be.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It didn’t take long before my attempts at control utterly failed.&nbsp; I just wasn’t able to orchestrate an Instagram-worthy quarantine.&nbsp; I found I couldn’t bear the sound of the television, so we listened to worship music on repeat - sometimes the same song, over and over.&nbsp; I didn’t learn how to bake bread.&nbsp; I completely lost my cool with my daughter and slammed every door between the garage and my bedroom.&nbsp; I couldn’t stay on top of my own transition to working from home while managing my daughter’s academic load, too.&nbsp; So I didn’t.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Instead, our pandemic has been slow and quiet.&nbsp; We’ve been walking down our country road daily and&nbsp;slowed down enough to notice the change from winter to spring. We watched as daffodils bloomed, then tulips, irises, and now peonies and honeysuckle.&nbsp; We noticed trees flowering and the birds who live in our backyard.&nbsp; We’ve sat on the porch together, watching our neighbors bale hay.&nbsp; We’ve called friends and Zoomed and laughed and cried.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s almost a cliché to say this now.&nbsp; But I’ve learned that it’s OK to not be OK.&nbsp; God doesn’t need me to be high functioning in the middle of a global pandemic.&nbsp; My family is going to be OK if we don’t get out of our pajamas, if we eat salsa for lunch, if we’re still up watching Netflix at 11 PM.&nbsp; My relationship with my daughter is going to survive the pandemic even if I hide in my room and lock the door for a couple hours.&nbsp; I’m still an awesome woman of God if I dwell on one line of scripture every day instead of using this time to deep dive into Ephesians.&nbsp; I’m still a great employee if I need to establish and enforce boundaries about how long I will devote my attention in a Zoom meeting or when I’ll respond to an email.&nbsp; If I need more help, in the form of counseling, that’s OK, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In fact, God’s goodness, mercy, and power are more precious and obvious when my attempts at control have finally frayed.&nbsp; I’m so grateful for the evidence I’ve seen, over and over, of how God has been orchestrating my peace in the midst of this season, coordinating precious moments of laughter for me and my daughter, giving me moments of silence when I’m overwhelmed with the noise of news and commentary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As we transition to a life after this pandemic, I pray that I won’t forget these lessons.&nbsp; I pray that I won’t step back into the life I had before without really considering the cost to my peace.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer:&nbsp; </strong>Lord, you have our attention. Please, Lord, reveal to us what you would have us take away from this season. Show us what we need to leave in our “pre-pandemic” lives.&nbsp; Show us what we need more of in our lives now. Be ever present, Lord, and teach us how to be more like You.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <title>The Wanderers</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2020/7/13/the-wanderers</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading:</strong><em> </em>“In a desert&nbsp;land he found him,&nbsp;in a barren and howling waste. He shielded&nbsp;him and cared for him;&nbsp;he guarded him as the apple of his eye.”<em> </em>Deuteronomy 32:10</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I made my choice for college on “Decision Day”, the last day possible to make the decision. One month after graduating from college, I accepted an assistantship for graduate school just as I was leaving for vacation. More recently, I accepted a contract for my current job in Charlottesville on the Fourth of July in 2017, without even visiting, and just about a month before the position was set to start. Prior to all of these monumental decisions, and many smaller ones in between, I wondered if I was making the right choice because I had other carefully thought out plans. That is the problem, though, when I look at my journey through this perspective- it isn’t really about my plans. Time and time again, God was directing and protecting me while I took my sweet time getting to where I am today- geographically and spiritually.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Thankfully, while in graduate school, after a semester of feeling particularly lost, I decided to attend a Christian service and gave my life to Christ that day. I wish I could say that was the end of my wandering, but as you can tell from the story above, I continued to resist what God had for me. I finally made it to Charlottesville, attended The Point in the first few weeks, got connected to a group soon after, and the rest is God. I consider The Point my home and often think “If only I had come sooner.” Here’s the thing- I almost applied to graduate school at UVA, but God knew I wasn’t ready to be there yet.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I think back over the past few years, I think of myself like the wandering Israelites. They were so close to the Promised Land, yet continued to doubt, disobey, and put their faith into things other than God. Yet through all of their wandering, God did not abandon them. Moses reminds the Israelites of this as they are about to enter Canaan: God protected them, provided for them, and continued to fulfill his promises. Unfortunately, for the Israelites, entering the Promised Land was not the end of the story. They continued to sin, which led to destruction. Fortunately for them and us, God STILL kept His promises by sending Jesus to serve as the ultimate sacrifice for sin.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We should take comfort in the fact, that despite all of our wandering, doubt, and sin, God keeps the promises to us as well. He finds us in pits of despair, dragging our feet in disobedience, or hopelessly wandering pursuing our plans. Even still, He gives us comfort and guidance and will lead us to the Promised Land.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reflection:&nbsp; </strong>What are you allowing to keep you from God’s promises? Where do you need to obey and trust God’s plan over your own?</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading:</strong>"By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 13:35)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is something in the Holy Week story that always takes my breath away.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything was getting ready to shift into high gear, and every moment counted as Jesus knew exactly when He would be arrested… This was a KAIROS moment of all KAIROS moments, and the clock was counting down.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus prayed a very specific intercessory prayer in some of His last moments of “freedom”.&nbsp;&nbsp;VERY specific, because Jesus was and is ALWAYS very specific.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And the final part of His penultimate “private” intercessory prayer — the long one before His final brief one in the Garden — before His arrest — was for US.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">(The first time I ever read John 17, as a new Christian over 45 years ago; I marveled, “Wow, Jesus prayed this for Me!”&nbsp;&nbsp;Because that’s what John 17:20 says… For ME!)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">YOU and ME.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">TODAY.&nbsp;&nbsp;RIGHT NOW.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">WE WERE ON HIS MIND.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And He prayed ONE THING, over and over.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You Bible students KNOW that from Genesis to Revelation — when God or Jesus REPEATS SOMETHING — that’s a BIG “HEADS UP.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John 17 is the longest recorded prayer that we have from Jesus.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is deeply significant.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">First, Jesus sought God for Himself; next, He prayed for His disciples.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the final six verses of the chapter were for all future believers.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He prayed hard for UNITY as Christians. As far as I can tell from the text, He prayed at least FOUR TIMES for unity:&nbsp;&nbsp;that we would all be one, just as He and His Father are One.&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not pray for prominence, or governmental power, or money, or favor, or easy lives. Out of everything He could pray for, He prayed over and over for UNITY. Because He surely knew that we were going to need it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Warren Wiersbe&nbsp;said of&nbsp;John 17:&nbsp;“The disciples had often exhibited a spirit of selfishness, competition, and disunity, and this must’ve broken the Saviour’s heart.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It still does.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We are RELATED.&nbsp;&nbsp;WAY deeper than DNA, we are ONE.&nbsp;&nbsp;DNA is physical and temporal; our relationship as believers is spiritual and eternal.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no “us” and “them”.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I am a Christian, I have to find a way to let that one go. A root of bitterness, no matter how “justified”, is never justified in God’s eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gary M. Burge says,&nbsp;“Jesus envisages a profound spiritual intimacy that changes human life.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is part of the hard work of sanctification in each believer’s heart, to seek out any bitter roots and hand them over to God.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unforgiveness, bias, meanness, unfairness, prejudice; any thing that we “hold on to”, we have to give to God for Him to remove the bitter root and cleanse our hearts and tell us what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;Across family divisions, generations, races, cultures, politics… It’s way more than a two-way street because it applies to every believer in all directions; but it so intimately centers on each of us and God.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">HE DIED TO MAKE US ONE.&nbsp;&nbsp;I kneel for that, and I lock arms for that, and I stand for that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maranatha.&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, Lord Jesus.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Father, begin with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this volatile, confusing world, search in my own heart for any bitter roots, which defile many and from which You have promised each of us a way of escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, I might “look okay” to the whole world, but I want to look right to YOU.&nbsp;&nbsp;Expose what I need to see, and help me to deal with it thoroughly; exactly as You command.&nbsp;&nbsp;Look across all my relationships: family, friends, work, church, neighbors, community… across political and racial and cultural lines; show me any biases and meanness and unkindness in my own heart… If I need to make amends — show me how, and let me be quick to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I need to forgive someone even if they do not seek forgiveness — let me be quick and thorough to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;Father, sometimes this is overwhelming and might even seem “unfair” and maybe “too much to ask”; and yet You insist… Help me to loosen my death grip on anything that I need to let go of; to hold that heavy thing lightly in my hand and give it all into Your Hands, over and over, as many times as it takes — until it is done forever and there is total freedom and peace with You.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts.&nbsp;&nbsp;See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the everlasting way.” (Psalm 139:23-24)</p>

      <title>Blank Canvas</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2020/7/31/blank-canvas</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading:&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>"When I consider Thy heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars which Thou hast fixed; O Lord, our Lord, How majestic is Thy name in all the earth!"<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Psalm 8:3 and 9</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br>Funny Story, when I was asked if I’d like to share some thoughts, a catchy title came to mind. I soon realized that I’d unintentionally plagiarized it from a lesson series. Somewhat discouraged it occurred to me that I was then working with a blank canvas…<br><br>But the truth is God has given us all the brushes, paints and scenery we could ever need. He always does that, doesn't He? The foundation is Jesus. Luke 6:46-49 and Matthew 7:24-27 explain the difference between just hearing His Words and hearing and acting upon them. When we hear and obey we've built our "house" with a deep foundation which rests on the rock. In Matthew 16:18 Jesus said He would build His church on the rock, which is the fact that Jesus is "the Christ, the Son of the living God." (v16)<br><br>So we know we have the foundation for everything - Jesus our Savior. And in knowing Him we learn to experience joy from using the gifts He's given us to serve Him by serving others. The canvas is getting full and colorful now, right?<br><br>I had a "blank canvas" experience about four months ago when we were all caught off guard and found ourselves in quarantine. My full calendar was suddenly empty and I became discouraged... loneliness, lack of purpose, fear of the unknown... feelings not unique to me, yet very real and personal. But fast forward and I find that while I still don't understand the "what," "when," "why," "where" and "how" of it all, I'm trusting more fully each day the "Who." I'm so grateful to know "Who" wasn't caught off guard; "Who" can make dinner for thousands from a few loaves of bread and a couple fish; "Who" has been in control since before the beginning of time; and "Who" loved us so much that He sent His Son to die in our place, then raised Him from the dead just as He had promised.<br><br>I love what Cara Whitney (Larry the Cable Guy's wife) says, "Comprehending God's plan can wait, obeying God's will cannot." Now she didn't write that little nugget during a global pandemic, but that's when I read it and that was no accident.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So the One who placed the moon and the stars in the sky and created beautiful landscape scenes that we enjoy everyday ensures that we're never working from a blank canvas. We have everything we need to be the artists He created us to be.<br><br><strong>Prayer:&nbsp;</strong>Dear Lord, help us to remember Your promise that Your grace is sufficient. Help us to fully trust You with every facet of our lives and to understand more everyday just how much You love each and every one of us.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Jesus' Name. Amen</p>

      <title>Good Reception</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;"We love because he first loved us." 1 John 4:19.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I need to hear this just now and at many other times.&nbsp; I know the two great commandments of the Law, the commandments to love God with all I have and am and to love my neighbor as myself.&nbsp; And I know that the standard goes even higher in the "new commandment" Jesus gives us: that I am to love my fellow Christians, who are in Christ with me and know God, not just as I love myself, but as Jesus loves them.&nbsp; And I truly long to love God--and my brothers and sisters in Christ--that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I can hear these great commandments and wonder how I may get a grip on such a high standard for my own life.&nbsp; Perhaps I doubt that it is possible.&nbsp; Of course, I know I can never equal the love of Jesus himself!&nbsp; And He is not asking me to do the impossible, he who knows my limitations better than I know them.&nbsp; But clearly by stating these commandments in the way he does, Jesus wants and calls me to aspire greatly, to aim very high indeed.&nbsp; How can I practically even start to do that?&nbsp; Am I making a key mistake that holds me back?&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"We love because he first loved us."&nbsp; This clearly tells me that I must first receive God's love before I can become good at giving love.&nbsp; Receiving love is prior to giving love. And I must receive God's love fully, abundantly, voraciously so that he can elevate my capacity to love.&nbsp; Otherwise, I start to notice that my love is weaker than I know it might be.&nbsp; I need to sit in the Lord's presence and ask that his abundant love and grace fall upon me and inundate my being.&nbsp; This is delightful to do and gives joy to my spirit.&nbsp; It is a prayer for the Holy Spirit that Jesus said our heavenly Father will not refuse.&nbsp; Why am I so slow to simply bask in the Lord's love and grace?&nbsp; It is the fountain of all that is best in my life.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Perhaps I fail at this partly because of another Scripture that I hear so often: "It is better to give than to receive."&nbsp; In Acts 20:35 Paul gives this dictum as a&nbsp; saying of Jesus.&nbsp; It seems to mandate that I should focus more on giving than on receiving.&nbsp; But here I need to go deeper or I will trip.&nbsp; Of course, it is better to give than to receive--and the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are infinitely "better" than I am!&nbsp; And so my truest relationship with them will mostly be their giving and my receiving!&nbsp; And I need to embrace this with all my heart fully to receive the abundance of their love and grace.&nbsp; This is what I want and this I pray for unabashedly.&nbsp; Only when I love with the love he gives me do I have any hope of loving my brothers and sisters as Jesus loves them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And this is the final key for me.&nbsp; I need to be deeply humble before my Lord; I need&nbsp; to acknowledge that I am his poor and humble servant.&nbsp; Without him I am utterly destitute.&nbsp; I need to see this over and over.&nbsp; With him I can be rich far beyond my imagination.&nbsp; If I am not humble, I will not ask for much!&nbsp; I have to be very humble to ask unstintingly for the abundance of his love and grace--over and over again--and receive it--over and over again!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Lord, I prostrate myself before you as your poor and humble servant.&nbsp; Forgive my sins.&nbsp; Pour into me the full abundance of your love and grace.&nbsp; Give me a mind and heart ready to receive them.&nbsp; And carve a deep channel in my being so that your very love may flow out of me in love for my brothers and sisters.&nbsp; I ask in Jesus' name.&nbsp; Amen.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading: </strong><em>“.&nbsp;</em>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;this very night there stood before me an angel of&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration:underline">the God to whom I belong and whom I worship</span>. . . .&nbsp;<strong>take&nbsp;heart</strong>&nbsp;. . . for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told.”&nbsp;Acts 27:23, 25</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I always hated when someone told me after some bad decision, “I told you so.”&nbsp; My in-the-head reply:&nbsp; “Yeah, whatever; too late for that now, and you're not helping.” &nbsp;But if someone said, "There's still hope," they had my ear!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Paul became that person to the crew and passengers on his “cruise” to Rome (Acts&nbsp;27:1-28:16).&nbsp; He was appealing his case to Caesar.&nbsp; (The Jews of Jerusalem wanted this troublemaker dead.)&nbsp; Winds were contrary on every leg of the journey, and despite every skilled effort by pilot and crew—hugging the shoreline, staying on the lee side of islands—it was very slow-going.&nbsp; They tried dipping down to Crete, a long, narrow island in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea.&nbsp; With much difficulty, they finally made it to Fair Haven, a harbor midway along Crete’s southern coast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Paul warned those in charge not to try sailing farther.&nbsp; Autumn and its treacherous weather were upon them. &nbsp;But the centurion in charge chose to listen to the pilot and the ship’s owner:&nbsp; Press on to a more suitable harbor.&nbsp; Finally, a good breeze came.&nbsp; They gambled on reaching Phoenix at the far western edge of Crete, just 45 miles and a much better place to hole up for winter. &nbsp;But no sooner had they set out than a fierce, blasting wind came from land to shore, blowing them out to sea—“reasonable risk” turned “bad bet.”&nbsp; Ever tried leaping across a stream and realized, too late, that it's six inches wider than your&nbsp;best jump?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So it was here:&nbsp; This ill-advised decision cast them into storm-tossed seas that forced them to jettison cargo, then the ship’s tackle, and, finally, all hope of being saved.&nbsp; They bobbed around for two weeks under dark skies, so occupied with surviving that they didn’t even eat.&nbsp; Then Paul told the others, “Take heart!” which could be translated, "Cheer up!" (Acts&nbsp;27:22 &amp; 25).&nbsp; He learned from an angel of God how it would turn out:&nbsp; All 276 would survive, but the ship would be lost.&nbsp; In the following hours, the ship lodged on a reef and was dashed to pieces, but everyone made it to shore and, ultimately, to Rome.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We, too, are sometimes subject to circumstances beyond our control or consequences of decisions by others, whether the pilot of a storm-tossed plane, an errant Uber driver, the drunken driver barreling toward a light that turned red for him but green for you, or the unwitting carrier of a virus.&nbsp; As Paul said to his hopeless companions, take heart—cheer up!&nbsp; We may not receive angelic assurances in the current circumstance, but we know with certainty, by faith, how it all turns out. &nbsp;It’s no gamble to trust our God, who delivered us from darkness to light, death to life, hopelessness to assurance of salvation and eternal life.&nbsp; Our prayer, both now and from now on, can be,&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>"Dear Father,&nbsp;the God to whom I belong and whom I worship,&nbsp;Your&nbsp;will be done, Your good purpose be fulfilled in my life and the lives of those dear to me.&nbsp; Thank You now and forever.&nbsp; Amen."</em></strong></p>

      <title>Staying Positive in a World that’s Increasingly Negative</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2020/9/2/iuyoaaobvny8j4b36hmofzdddgrzv5</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading: &nbsp;</strong>A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit&nbsp;drieth&nbsp;the bones. Proverbs 17: 22</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Part of being happy is having and maintaining a positive attitude.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank God for being a God of delivered promises. &nbsp;He never said our lives would be easy, but He promised He would walk beside us and&nbsp;carry our burdens if we let Him.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My earliest memories of being positive were ones reinforced&nbsp;by my mom. &nbsp;Simply put, we&nbsp;were not allowed to&nbsp;be negative!&nbsp;When mom went on her “being positive” rant, we glued our mouths shut, focused&nbsp;our eyes&nbsp;on her and took our tough&nbsp;love. &nbsp;After our lecture we&nbsp;said “Yes ma’am”&nbsp;and then retreated&nbsp;to our rooms. You bet&nbsp;there was eye rolling&nbsp;and sticking our tongues out when&nbsp;shecouldn’t see us!&nbsp;Just because I was taught to be positive doesn’t mean that it was easy, nor did I always want to be. &nbsp;It’s really a life-long practice that leads&nbsp;to joy and contentment.&nbsp;Any habit&nbsp;worth cultivating requires practice and do-overs,&nbsp;over and over again! &nbsp;Here are a few things that have made&nbsp;me&nbsp;more successful in maintaining a positive attitude.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1.&nbsp;Spend time with God daily and pray about anything and everything. &nbsp;Ask God to change your heart and mind. &nbsp;Several years ago I attended a Point Women’s Day and we were given a key and chain to remind us to allow God free access to our heart and to unlock any doors for him to enter and create heart change. &nbsp;Since then that key&nbsp;hangs&nbsp;from my car mirror. Every time I am in my car I&nbsp;am reminded of&nbsp;this. I&nbsp;hold the key and&nbsp;tell God it is his and to&nbsp;use it and create the heart in me He wants. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2.&nbsp;Do a 30 day thankful/grateful journal. &nbsp;Each day&nbsp;write 3 things you are thankful or grateful for. Meditate&nbsp;and pray thanks over them.&nbsp;I did this 3 years ago inDecember&nbsp;and that&nbsp;journaling changed my life for the better.&nbsp;&nbsp;I found I was blessed beyond belief!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">3.&nbsp;Change your dialogue. &nbsp;“I can’t” becomes “I will”. &nbsp;“I have to” becomes “I get to” and I really use this one, usually every Monday! &nbsp;I find myself saying I don’t want to go to work today. &nbsp;Quickly I change that to&nbsp;I get to go to work today! &nbsp;I get up and dressed in a cozy home with&nbsp;clothes to choose from and I get to jump in a car with gas to go and serve where I work. &nbsp;I have an opportunity to make a difference in someone’s&nbsp;life by showing a positive attitude and having a merry heart!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">4.&nbsp;If&nbsp;you are able, set aside a little piece of change each month to give away. &nbsp;I just started this January 2020. &nbsp;It allows me to give a small blessing to someone I know,&nbsp;don’t know, or&nbsp;to a favorite charity. &nbsp;It gives me an opportunity to speak life into another person,allows me to love my neighbor&nbsp;and share the blessings God&nbsp;has given to me.&nbsp;If your finances don’t allow,&nbsp;look for service opportunities in your community. &nbsp;Your time can be just what someone may need.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m thankful for my parents who&nbsp;practiced tough love on me. &nbsp;It&nbsp;may have taken years for me to&nbsp;realize their wisdom and the gifts that produced. &nbsp;I’m thankful for times when I had poor health, God has completely healed me. &nbsp;He is&nbsp;not finished with me and he is not finished with you! &nbsp;If you need some further verses for thought see:&nbsp;Prov15:15, 1 Tim 6:6,&nbsp;Is&nbsp;55:12, Ps 16:11,&nbsp;Neh&nbsp;8:10.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer: &nbsp;</strong>Father God, Thank you for showing me that positivity is a journey and not a destination. &nbsp;Help me to focus on what you have provided and given to me. &nbsp;May&nbsp;I always see my cup as full,&nbsp;running over with your&nbsp;blessings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Help me to always offer a smile, a kind word and a helping hand to others. &nbsp;May who you are be reflected in my&nbsp;actions.&nbsp;Amen.</p>

      <title>Freedom from the Mindset of Captivity</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2021/1/11/freedom-from-the-mindset-of-captivity</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading: </strong>“If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and are overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning.” 2 Peter 2:20</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I learned several years ago that having a “mindset of freedom” went along hand-in-hand with living a life of freedom, however, I also came to realize that one could definitely exist without the other; we can be deemed free by knowing Christ Jesus and accepting Him as our Lord and Savior, but still have the mindset and actions of a captive. I was saved at the age of 33, after I entered into a discipleship/rehabilitation program. Before going into the program, I had struggled with addiction for twenty-two years, not to mention my childhood that was filled with deep hurt and trauma. So, by the time I had come to the end of myself, I was physically and mentally shackled to addiction, negative thinking, and to the ways of the world. I knew exactly what it meant to live according to the flesh and to be a captive and slave to sin. After giving my life to Christ, I truly believed in my heart that I had been set free and that I was forgiven, but my mind wasn’t on the same page as my heart. No, my mind was still a prisoner to what it once knew, and it would take a daily conscious effort to align my mind and heart to God’s Word so that I could fully live out the gift of freedom that I had been given. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There was one scripture that stuck with me from the very beginning of my journey, and I saw with my own eyes the warning of this verse come alive in the lives of those who would turn back to their old ways after being saved. 2 Peter 2:20, was the verse of awakening for me and I took heed to this warning, and I never went back. Day in and day out, I asked God to not only work in my heart, but also to work in my mind. I developed the habit of living out the Word in my daily life and putting it to practice so that my brain would develop a new way of thinking, and my new thoughts then became new actions. And then the day came, I finally experienced freedom from the mindset of captivity, my heart and my mind were working together in harmony and not separated from one another.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What I came to understand was that it was just as important for the heart to experience transformation as it was for the mind, and I understood by the warning of this scripture that one can certainly exist without the other; and when they exist separate from each other, we are only partially free. Jesus came so that we could live a life of complete freedom, mind, body and soul! It had become clear to me that I had a choice to make (as we all do), that I was either captive to my thoughts, or that I was going to take my thoughts captive; one of these always leads us back and the other always leads us forward in the fullness and freedom to which we were called to live. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>“Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your transformational power! Lord, I ask that You would break down the prison walls in the minds of those that are still in captivity and that they would begin to experience the fullness of freedom in Christ Jesus. Amen!” </em></strong></p>

      <title>Faith Over Fear</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2021/1/25/fear-not-during-covid</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As I was taking a walk, I stopped to chat with a neighbor, and we mentioned that we missed visiting with each other.&nbsp;She suggested we could sit on my porch at a distance, but since I feel the cold easily, that doesn’t work for me in the winter. I offered to invite her into my house, but she quickly responded with a fearful, “No, I don’t go into anybody’s house right now.&nbsp;We haven’t seen our children and grandchildren in a long time.”&nbsp;I completely understand her fear - this disease can be deadly.&nbsp; </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So we turn to God and what He says.&nbsp;We try to live our lives trusting Him especially in the hard situations in our lives. He says repeatedly “<em>Do not fear, be anxious for nothing</em>.” We want to live our lives obeying what He says and trusting Him rather than living in fear.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There needs to be a balance between just trusting that we will not get the virus and, therefore, living without any caution (going anyplace we want, being with many people) <em>or</em> going the opposite way and giving into fear that cripples us, leaving us terrified.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What does God say to us about fear and living with His wisdom?&nbsp; </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“So do not fear, for I am with you, do not be dismayed, for I am your God.&nbsp; I will strengthen you and help you.&nbsp; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.” Isa. 41:10</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We can depend on the absolute truth that God is with us and He will strengthen and help us.&nbsp; There is no maybe about it.&nbsp;When fear assails, and it will, we can put our faith in this truth.&nbsp;Take time to affirm this truth to yourself – God is with me so I don’t need to let fear cripple me.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Be anxious for nothing, but in everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God and the peace of God which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” Phil. 4:6-7</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Anxiety and fear will come given the current environment in which we live.&nbsp;But when it comes, this verse tells us what to do. Bring our fear to God in prayer with thanksgiving that He is in control in every situation, including COVID, and then experience His peace to guard our hearts and minds.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So as you stop letting fear guide your life, there is still the question of how to live in a world with COVID. Pastor Gabe has been preaching much about God’s wisdom as we study Proverbs.&nbsp;Rather than fear guiding us, we want God’s wisdom to guide us.&nbsp; James 1:5-6 tells us to ask God in faith without doubting for wisdom and it will be given.&nbsp;When you are not sure what to do, where to go, and where not to go, what people you can see, seek God for His wisdom.&nbsp;He promises to guide us.&nbsp;He will guide through His Word, His Spirit and counsel of others.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>“Heavenly Father, I am thankful that You are sovereign and You have not given me a spirit of fear but power, love and a sound mind.&nbsp;I confess that sometimes I have let fear guide me during this time.&nbsp;Thank You Lord for forgiving me because of Jesus’ death for me. I put my trust in You and seek to hear Your wisdom through Your Word, Your Spirit and counsel of others.&nbsp;Use my life during this time to reveal You to others.”</em></strong></p>

      <title>Steady</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2021/1/4/steady</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading:&nbsp;</strong>“My heart is steadfast, O God; I will sing, I will sing praises, even with my soul.” (Psalm 108:1) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">During one of my grad school moves, I distinctly remember struggling to carry out my mattress. The problem was not that it was too heavy. No, this poor little guy was flimsy as could be. So much so, you could barely lift it. And the accompanying bed was not much better - I don’t know where it came from, but I am pretty sure it was free. The wooden slats that held up the box springs tended to fall out during the night. One thing was made clear; it was time for a new bed! And not surprisingly, once I made that exchange, both my sleep and my back improved.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sometimes our spiritual lives are a lot like that sad mattress. They may look good on the surface (as my bed did when covered with a bedspread and pillows), but “flimsy” is a more accurate description when we take a closer look. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When things get tough, our natural tendency is to give up, run away, hide, pretend, or point fingers. But God has something better in mind. Through His power, we can be strong, secure, steady, and stable.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Recently, I have been challenged by Ephesians 6:13, “Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm.” This section of scripture repeatedly urges us to stand firm. In other words, it is not automatic. We have to work at it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our spiritual strength is linked directly to the armor of God. Do you know what the first piece of armor listed here is? The belt of truth. We don’t grow strong by ignoring our shortcomings, but rather by facing them head-on. Standing firm always begins with truth.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For me, this involves identifying unhealthy thinking patterns and replacing them with God’s Word. Recently, I took the time to address some of my weaknesses in the form of a declaration. Here are a few examples:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am content and satisfied. (Psalm 131)</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am chosen to display the character of God. (Colossians 3:12)</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My prayers are powerful. (James 5:16)</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have a ministry. And it matters. (Colossians 4:17)</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am steady. I don’t give up, and I don’t quit. (Ephesians 6:10)</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The start of a new year is the perfect time to “pull back the covers,” so to speak, and examine our hearts and minds. Take a few minutes to reflect on the following:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What is it that causes you to grow “flimsy”?</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What unhealthy thinking do you need to replace with a declaration of truth?</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What does God have to say about your shortcomings and weaknesses?</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>“God, my heart is steady because You are steady. I choose to stand firm – not giving up, not running away, and not giving in. You are powerful, strong, and trustworthy. You never leave me, and You never forsake me. I can trust in you, even when life is insecure. I can find peace in chaos, strength in the storms, and joy in the trials. Amen.”</em></strong></p>

      <title>Real and Raw</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2021/12/1/real-and-raw</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading: </strong>“The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?&nbsp;The Lord is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?&nbsp;Though an army encamp against me, my heart shall not fear;&nbsp;though war arise against me, yet I will be confident.” (Psalm 27:1,3 ESV)&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Hey, how are you?” my friend asks me. “Doing well,” I reply. “Hey! Doing alright today?” my co-worker asks. “Yep, doing just fine,” I reply. “Everything going well, Caleb?” my boss inquires. “Yes, all is well,” I reply.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I don’t know about you, but sometimes I get really tired of talking about how I’m doing.&nbsp; And honestly, sometimes I wish people would just stop asking me — because if they wouldn’t ask, I wouldn’t have to <em>lie </em>about how I’ve been.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The last year and a half of my life has hosted some of the most difficult things I’ve ever had to walk through. From serious health issues in my immediate family to difficult situations in the workplace, I’ve run the gamut of emotions from anxiety to burnout in the last 18 months. And yet, every time someone asks how I’m doing, I shift into autopilot and say exactly what I believe they want to hear: “<em>I’m doing well</em>.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you’re anything like me, you do this too. You can be at your absolute breaking point — yet, for fear of being looked at differently or admitting weakness, you withhold and give the answer that's the easiest to swallow. And, odds are, if you and I are doing this with our friends and our coworkers, we're also doing it with God. Rather than approaching God in pure honesty, we guard our prayers and give God the easy "I'm doing well" spiel. But this isn't what God desires; He wants our unfiltered honesty and raw emotion, and He wants to remind us of His faithfulness in the midst of it.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">David models this honesty for us in Psalm 27. The positivity that David displays isn't fake or overdone, and it's surely not an "I'm doing well" kind of response: it's grounded in the truth of God's faithfulness. David openly acknowledges that his situation is difficult — impossible, even — but he remains confident in his stronghold and his light in even the darkest of situations: the Lord. David points at his circumstances and recognizes them for what they are: brutal, unfair, and downright difficult. He is adamant about processing <em>with </em>His God, and it is in this processing that David regains his confidence in the One who is his unwavering hope — his light in the darkness.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you and I can learn to employ honesty with God like David's — if we can learn to process <em>with </em>God rather than <em>hide </em>it from Him — we will come to the conclusion that even when our situation is dark, even when we don’t know what to do, even when we don’t see God or feel Him at times, He is right there by our side, casting healing light into our darkness.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Take a moment to be absolutely honest and straightforward with God about the difficulty you're currently facing. Lay it all out before Him in the way that is uniquely you.&nbsp; Process with Him, confess to Him, wrestle with Him — leave nothing unsaid or understated. God desires your honesty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>Father, you know me better than I even know myself. You know my deficiencies. You know my fears. You know my hang-ups. You know what I’m going through right now,&nbsp; and You know how much I’m struggling with it. So, in this moment, I want to be entirely honest with You. I refuse to drift into autopilot and withhold any part of me from You. I trust that You have my back, that You care for me, and that You truly are good. Remind me of Your love as I process with You in this season. Thank you for Your presence and Your Holy Spirit that guides me in this process. In Jesus’ name</em></strong><br></p>

      <title>The Reason We Burn</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2021/12/15/the-reason-we-burn</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading:</strong> “You are the light of the world.” (Matthew 5:14 NIV)&nbsp;                                                                        “He will not crush the weakest reed or put out a flickering candle.” (Isaiah 42:3 NLT)&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Father God, if I’m <em>the light of the world</em>, then I must be failing You.” Do you ever find yourself thinking or praying something like that? It can be hard to believe Jesus’ declaration when you feel more like a smoking match. The truth is, regardless of how you feel, His plan for you has not changed. You are actually positioned to be stoked by His Spirit.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Keep in mind the Lord is not disappointed when you feel burned out. He knows we can grow weary, discouraged, and disheartened. Life spins us through cycles of wins and losses, joy and grief, and every day can hold innumerable highs and lows. He has lived here just like us and His soul was put to the test as well. Perhaps this is one reason why He tells us, <em>“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest." </em>(Matthew 11:28 NIV) He understands.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The prophet Isaiah gave us this image: “<em>He will not... put out a flickering candle.” </em>(<em>Isaiah 42:3) </em>The Lord sees you flickering away and feels compassion for you. It reminds me of the burning candles we may hold during&nbsp; a candlelight service (or the smoke-free alternative… glow sticks). You protect that little flame by surrounding it with your cupped hand. That is how the Lord carries you, close to Himself and covered. That’s grace. You are accepted as you are even when you are barely smoldering. He tends to you until your soul is energized by His love, burning for others to see Him.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Relief comes when you open yourself to the Lord’s constant love. His love becomes your fuel. Pause from the noise of your day to consider how He has rescued you. Remember His faithfulness in past trials. Notice the beauty of His creation surrounding you and the things you enjoy that He’s given to you. Let His Word roll around in your mind. When you consider Him, who is light and love, the Holy Spirit ignites within you. You are a carrier of His light and love in the world.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>Father God, thank You that Your Word says those who look to You for help will be radiant with joy. I look to You. Please ignite my love and help me to burn brightly for You today. It is in Jesus Christ’s name that I pray, amen.</em></strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br><br></p>

      <title>Achievable Goals for 2021</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2021/2/17/achievable-goals-for-2021</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading: </strong>“Yet you, Lord, are our Father. We are the clay, you are the potter; we are all the work of your hand.” Isaiah 64:8 </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Do you like to set goals in a new year? I read somewhere that almost half of Americans make New Year’s resolutions but only 8% stick to their goals. I am definitely not in that 8% successful group! My resolve to be a goal-oriented person starts strongly at 6 a.m. but by 5 p.m. I can have a completely different attitude. For years I gave up making formal resolutions because adhering to them was so tough. It was discouraging to set a goal and miss the mark time and time again. “Maybe I’m not setting the right goals,” I eventually concluded. “Maybe there’s a better way to help my growth and development. What does God think about all of this?” I wondered.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We’re far enough into 2021 to see it will require a lot of flexibility to function well. Amidst a different set of challenging circumstances, the prophet Isaiah realized something special about God’s people. He noted that are we being *made* by God’s hand. We are clay, not a finished project yet, still in the development phase. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When a work of pottery is being created, it is the maker who chooses how to shape the object. The potter decides what to make the clay into and what traits it will have. Our development process is the same.&nbsp;God, our Potter, is molding us into something new. He picks our features and purposes. He shapes us into what He wills us to be. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In a world of Covid, personal, political, and economic crises, God shows us through his word he wants to mold our hearts and lives. He desires to shape us into His pre-planned pottery! God has goals for YOU in 2021. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As you consider setting resolutions for this year or lament the ones you have already made and broken, what would it look like to embrace what God is teaching you in this season rather than make plans exclusively based off human objectives?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ask God specifically what traits He wants to birth in you in this season. What are His goals for your heart? Recently, He showed me that He wants me to become more mature by learning patience. And thank God, He has given me an abundance of opportunities to embrace it and practice patience in this crazy world! What is God molding you to be? Rather than fighting against the process, how can you welcome the Lord’s goals for you and embrace the ways He shapes you? You will find incredible purpose and success this year if you seek the Lord’s objectives for you, because God never fails at His goals. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>“Father, You are the Potter and I am the clay. I surrender to You. Soften my heart and show me how You want me to grow in this season. I want to embrace Your work in me, not fight against it.” </em></strong></p>

      <title>Finding Family</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2021/2/17/finding-family</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading</strong>:&nbsp;“Let all that you do be done with love.”&nbsp;1 Corinthians 16:14</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On November 15, 2020 I was baptized at The Point, and this is part of my testimony that was written on that day.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Church has always been a part of my life, and I’ve spent 50 years attending church, serving, teaching, and volunteering. However, I recently began feeling that God was leading me to make a change.&nbsp;My church family and activities were things that I had always enjoyed, but now I seemed to be on a quest for something deeper and truer to the real message of Jesus. I considered making that change and searching for more.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So I began praying for direction and set out on my journey. Part of my plan was to visit a few local churches.&nbsp;A friend told me about the Point, and the first Sunday I attended just happened to be a celebration of the Point’s 10th anniversary!&nbsp;There were balloons, kettle corn, and other fun surprises, but what stood out most to me were the love I experienced, prayer, and a strong sense of family.&nbsp;I loved that visit and felt a connection from the first welcoming handshake.&nbsp; The next Sunday I returned, and even without all the extra celebrations, the love, prayer and sense of family were still there, and were just as energizing and illuminating as before.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Soon I signed up for Growth Track, which has been very helpful to me in discovering my personal strengths and “purposeful design.” I’ve found several opportunities for serving and enjoy it very much.&nbsp;I’m also excited about the small groups I’ve attended and cannot speak highly enough about them and the way they continue to promote a strong sense of family. I highly recommend both of these programs to any new believers or members.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Yes, I felt at home that very first day.&nbsp;And now in our new church facility, the message on the wall reminds me of an amazing concept:&nbsp;“Love God, Love People, Love Life.”&nbsp;In fact, I have been focusing on LOVE, and find that it is a superpower!&nbsp;Jesus is my guide and example.&nbsp;I’ve also been reading God’s Word, journaling and praying the scriptures.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">During this process I’ve read a book by Bob Goff- <span style="text-decoration:underline">Love Does</span>. The author wrote one line that really stands out to me – “Love is a DO thing.&nbsp; It’s an energy that has to be dissipated.”&nbsp;This is what The Point is living and what I am aiming to do as well. “We love each other because He loved us first.” (1 John 4:19)&nbsp; Indeed, God is love, and He graciously puts us in church families where we can receive and share that love with others.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>“Thank you, Lord, for your great love for us, and for leading us to walk with you each day.&nbsp;As we follow you on our life’s journey, please guide us into all truth and use us for your kingdom.&nbsp;We love you and give you glory and praise.&nbsp;In Jesus’ name, Amen.”</em></strong></p>

      <title>That Was Then, This Is Now</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2021/3/17/nd4nf97e4x2end654z36gsqh69zeco</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading:</strong><em> </em>“And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” Matthew 28:20</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I haven’t traveled extensively, but have stepped foot in Washington, D.C. and Washington state; Toronto and Tijuana; Burlington, Wisconsin and Bermuda and several places in between. All have been memorable, but none so memorable as my trip to Israel. In my planning, I anticipated “walking where Jesus walked” and experiencing the Holy Land first-hand. Nothing - not even Pastor Gabe’s telling us how life-altering it would be - prepared me for what happened there.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m an “outline,” step-by-step, measure-twice-cut-once kind of person. This first, this next, then this - you get the picture. Why was I so surprised that the itinerary didn’t start in Bethlehem and end at Calvary? I mean, if I were to walk in His steps, wouldn’t we go where He went, the way He went, in the order He went? I am so glad we didn’t, as it enabled me to concentrate on where I was, rather than ponder the next location.&nbsp;So I focused on each step, which, by the way, is good advice when walking the sandal-polished stones of Jerusalem’s ancient streets!&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With each step where Jesus’s feet touched, “Jesus was HERE!” filled my thoughts…the small portion of stairway leading to the temple, still visible since He first walked those stones;&nbsp; the tortuous path to Golgotha, including one spot His blood and sweat most assuredly dripped onto the pavement; the Sea of Galilee’s sandy shore; the short path between Peter’s house and the nearby synagogue; the actual stairs He climbed to Caiaphas’s house; and the Garden of Gethsemane.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It happened in the Garden. Beautiful. Quiet. Peaceful. Yet, in the stillness, was an awareness of Jesus’s agony as He cried out to the Father, beseeched his companions to watch with Him, sweat great drops of blood, and surrendered to the perfect will of God. Imagining how it was, I prayed step-by-step through that Garden, telling myself again, “Jesus was HERE!” Suddenly, overwhelmingly, I sensed His presence, and heard Him speak to my heart, “I am here with you NOW!” There. There it was. As awesome, as inspiring, as emotional as it was to have planted my feet where He had planted His, it was there, in that Garden, that He reminded me in no uncertain terms that He is with us in the NOW. He agonized in the Garden there and then so He could be with us here and now. In every moment, every day, every triumph, every trial, He IS with us… in the exciting and the mundane; in the stress and the calm; in the joy and the grief...not WAS, but IS…<em> Is. With. Us. </em>He lives in the perpetual NOW!&nbsp;I will always treasure having followed His footsteps there and then, but more precious is knowing He’s walking with us here and now.&nbsp;Is your walk difficult?&nbsp;He’s walking with you.&nbsp;Are you plodding through grief? He’s beside you. Are you dancing with joy?&nbsp;He’s dancing with you. In every circumstance, we can embrace Him, His peace, His joy. Here. Now. Forever!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>“Lord, thank you that because of your immense love and perfect sacrifice, your everlasting presence is with us in every circumstance and situation. May we always be aware of that presence, knowing you are with us always, for you have said in your Word, “Never will I leave you, nor forsake you” (Hebrews 13:5). &nbsp;Remind us that you are walking with us every step of the way...when we rejoice, when we grieve, in special celebrations or in everyday routines. Let us long to know you more and more on our daily walk with you, as we study your Word, listen for your voice, and submit to your will. Amen.”</em></strong></p>

      <title>A Love Story…Love for Family, Love for God</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2021/3/31/a-love-storylove-for-family-love-for-god</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading: </strong>“This is the day that the Lord has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.”&nbsp; (Psalms. 118:24)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is one of my favorite verses.&nbsp;I start my morning prayer with this verse every day.&nbsp;It’s a verse that I relate to and a reminder that God is the one in control but it’s up to me to choose whether I’m grateful and/or joyful or whether I respond in a different way.&nbsp;This is a comfortable verse for me because I am grateful for each day and life is generally pretty good.&nbsp;It’s easy to be grateful and joyful when life is pretty good. However, I recognize that other people have circumstances in their lives that make this verse more challenging in terms of “rejoicing and being glad in it”.&nbsp;Trials present themselves and life starts to feel less gratifying and less joyful.&nbsp; How do we respond?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Last year I wrote a blog about a friend, “G”, who had suffered a life-threatening injury and how inspired I was by the way her family responded to this tragedy.&nbsp;I knew this was a strong family of faith but was completely in awe of how they were handling the situation. “T”, her husband, from the day of her injury had emphasized to his girls that each day was a gift, and they would praise God for any time they had, or any progress made. At the time no one knew what her future would look like. That is still true a year later. Because of the severity of her injury her health care has been extremely challenging including intensive care and long-term rehabilitation.&nbsp;To make the situation more difficult the world saw the emergence of Covid 19 which changed everything, including the approach and availability of medical care and rehabilitation.&nbsp;Because of Covid no one from her family could be with her in the medical rehab facility so they decided to take her home and provide 24-hour care. Their support team, which had included medical professionals and dozens of friends and family, was reduced down to her husband, her sister, and a mother/daughter care team. They, as a family, were, and continue to be, exhausted but have never given up hope.&nbsp;For most of us it would be difficult to continue to thank the Lord and be grateful or joyful for these circumstances.&nbsp;The family posts a daily blog to keep all of us informed on her progress.&nbsp;Every single post, while sometimes uplifting, sometimes depressing, never fails to give thanks to the Lord and show gratitude for the gift of that day. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">From the outside looking in this has been a painful journey to watch.&nbsp;However, it is also a story of amazing love of family members and love between this family and God.&nbsp;Painful to have so many unknowns and yet beautiful in that they have never blamed God or lost faith.&nbsp;I’m sure they have questions and ask “why” but that has never been their focus. The family refers to her journey as a marathon, not a sprint.&nbsp;They ask for prayers for their endurance and her healing.&nbsp;They are joyful with each small victory in her recovery and consider it their ministry to provide love and care.&nbsp;I think of James 1:2-3, “Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of any kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance”.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The family’s daily post, written by her husband, recently stated,“G” and I have talked about thanking him (God) for whatever comes our way. If we had his perspective, we could see why this is happening and the good that will come from it. I remind “G”, God must be really doing some good through our present trial. She seems to trust that encouragement and have hope in his promises.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In my life I have had seasons of highs and lows but nothing to this degree. This family inspires me every day to strive to have their complete trust in our Lord! They have shown me how to take each day and appreciate the gifts it brings. To me they embody Psalm 11:24 and how important it is, even when life isn’t that easy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>“Heavenly Father, thank you for the example of this beautiful family.&nbsp;We are so grateful that you never leave us to go through trials alone.&nbsp;Please help us continue to learn from you and to bring honor through our perseverance. In your precious name we pray.&nbsp;Amen.”</em></strong></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading:&nbsp; </strong>“. . . as [Peter and John] were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them, <span style="text-decoration:underline">greatly annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead</span>. And they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening. But many of those who had heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to about five thousand.” Acts 4:1-4</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">These days your words can get you in trouble.&nbsp;Saying the wrong thing can get you a reprimand in some quarters or even cost you your job.&nbsp;Words matter.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That’s no less true for Christians living out their faith in obedience to the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;We live in a day when Isaiah’s words of warning couldn’t be more true:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; Who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness; Who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!” Isaiah 5:20</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Today loud voices say you’re evil, dark, bitter if you’re a Christian.&nbsp;We can add hateful to Isaiah’s list.&nbsp; In times like these, dare we identify ourselves as Christians?&nbsp;Dare we reach out to others with the Good News about Jesus Christ?&nbsp;There could be a price to pay, as Peter and John experienced in their day.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s tempting to avoid trouble by hiding our faith, blending in, or fleeing the situation before we can be found out.&nbsp;But that creates a dilemma, because Jesus said, “whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” (Luke 9:26). Who wants that?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The other option is to believe, be bold, and speak out—in love.&nbsp;That seems insanely counterintuitive, but remember:&nbsp;We’re in a battle, not with people, but with dark forces in the spiritual realm.&nbsp;Paul told the Ephesians, “we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, . . . authorities, . . . cosmic powers over this present darkness, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places” (Ephesians 6:12).&nbsp;When we love people, even the ones who despise us and find us annoying, we’re doing what Jesus bid us to do (Matthew 5:44), and we’re following His example.&nbsp;Haters can become believers.&nbsp;Enemies can become friends.&nbsp;Remember Saul who became Paul?&nbsp;And we can be sure that the Holy Spirit is working in people’s hearts, just like He did in ours by convicting us of sin and leading us to faith in Jesus Christ.&nbsp;And He’s still using believers to reach nonbelievers.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It can be scary.&nbsp;Even the Apostle Paul needed prayer for words and boldness, asking the Ephesian church to pray “that words may be given to me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel, 20&nbsp;for which I am an ambassador in chains, that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak” (Ephesians 6:19-20).&nbsp;And what about Peter and John, whose words got them in trouble?&nbsp;Two things:&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;Some 5,000 became believers (Acts&nbsp;4:4); (2) they reported everything to their friends, prayed together, were filled with the Holy Spirit, and continued to speak out with boldness (Acts&nbsp;4:23-24, 31).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>“<em>Dear Father, empower us as believers in Jesus Christ to be light bearers in a dark world getting darker; channels of love in all its expressions in a time of division, distrust, and hate; victors in life, no matter what present battles we’re facing; and clear, calm voices boldly speaking the truth in love.&nbsp;Thank You for Your Spirit, working in us and through us, working in the hearts of those around us, some of whom will believe, if we speak out.&nbsp;Amen.”</em></strong></p>

      <title>God is at Work in Hard Seasons</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2021/4/28/god-is-at-work-in-hard-seasons</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading: </strong>“I lift up my eyes to the hills. From where does my help come? My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.”&nbsp;Psalm 121:1-2 ESV</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The other day I was texting with a fellow new mom friend about how chaotic and busy the season of new motherhood felt. We chatted about our shared season of having little ones, a season where you often don’t have a second to check-in on yourself and self-care takes the form of a 5-minute shower twice a week. We echoed each other’s sentiment of being in survival mode. And then these words were laid on my heart: “God is at work in my hard seasons.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have seen the mantra “I can do hard things” proclaimed a lot, especially in the past year. There are many days where I rephrase this mantra into “I have no choice but to do hard things”, but that isn’t the whole truth. The truth of the matter is that I can do hard things through Christ as my strength. As I look back on my life and analyze places of the greatest growth in my faith, they are tied to seasons of trial: seasons where I questioned who I was, what my purpose was, and if God really had a plan for my circumstances. I couldn’t see God at work, but I have learned to feel him at work in those seasons. Even when it seems like I am just in survival mode, there are things He is doing to mold, shape and refine me for the work ahead, as hard and painful as that might feel. If you too are experiencing a tough season, I want to encourage you with these three actions. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Look up</strong>. Take a second at least once a day to lift up your eyes. Remove your gaze from your circumstances and look up to the God of all comfort, strength, peace and grace, who loves you more than you can even begin to fathom. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Fill your cup</strong>. God has put people, positions, passions, and more in your life that require your time and attention. Most of these require much of you every single day. Remember the importance of filling your own cup first, so that you have something to give. This may look different for you than it does for me, but discovering what it is that fills your cup, can be one of the greatest gifts you can give to those around you. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Flower where you’re planted</strong>. I’m not sure about you, but I have killed many plants from overwatering them. Many plants need dry, parched conditions to thrive. You might find yourself in such conditions right now, and I encourage you to flower right where you are. Dry seasons are not without moments of joy and triumph. Your dry season, and the flowering you do in your dry season, will speak of God’s glory more than any #the-struggle-is-real Instagram post. Your flowers will speak to others in ways that only God can orchestrate and you might be just the encouragement someone needs to look for the blessings in their season. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>“Gracious God, I ask that you draw us near to you. May we look to you for our help and strength, no matter our circumstances. May we seek to glorify you in all that we say and do, and we commit all our seasons to your ultimate glory. Amen.”</em></strong></p>

      <title>Beauty in the Storm</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2021/5/11/beauty-in-the-storm</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading:&nbsp; </strong>He has made everything beautiful in its time. Ecclesiastes 3:11</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One of my favorite things to do is watch the sunset. Sunrises are great too because it feels like a gentle wake up from God.&nbsp;It’s like He is saying “Good morning, welcome to this new day I created for you.” A sunset, though, is such a bold and beautiful reminder that He has guided us&nbsp;through another day with Him.&nbsp;It’s one more gift from Him before my day is over.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sunsets are beautiful but they are not created equal. Have you ever seen a sunset after a storm?&nbsp;They have some of the most stunning colors I have ever seen. I love a good storm too!&nbsp; Sitting in the living room listening to the rain and thunder while watching the lightning can be relaxing. I know I am weird in saying this but...I even like it when the power goes out.&nbsp;With no power you have no choice but to sit and pay attention to what is going on around you.&nbsp;I love it!&nbsp;A storm can be cool and scary at the same time. Especially when you are in it. There can be a lot of power behind it.&nbsp;And with that power comes the uncertainty of what could happen.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is why we use storms to describe life.&nbsp;There are times when beautiful weather is predicted but a storm comes out of nowhere and causes major destruction.&nbsp;It’s the same with life.&nbsp;Life can be all good and then a storm comes out of nowhere. A friend moves, a job is lost, a child is sick, a spouse leaves, a parent dies, or countless other things that make us feel like our life is falling apart. Life can change in the blink of an eye just like the weather.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You want to know the best part of a storm and life? There is usually someone there during and after the storm that wants to help and make things better.&nbsp;Look for them and let them help.&nbsp;As silly as it sounds...let them be your sunset.&nbsp;Let them add beauty to your storm.&nbsp;You won’t regret it!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Over the past year I have been reminded of just how much beauty I actually have in my life.&nbsp;Last year was tough!&nbsp;There was lots of pain and tears.&nbsp;There was also a lot of love and hope. I lost 3 very important people in my life and my friends and family surrounded me with that love and hope even in the middle of a pandemic. They covered me in prayer and helped me find some joy.&nbsp;They helped me to see the sunset after my storm.&nbsp;I will forever be thankful to them for that.&nbsp;I pray you have someone in your life to add beauty to it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>“God, Help us to see the beauty you place in our lives. We know it may not always be as obvious as the bold and beautiful colors that are in the sky after a storm.&nbsp;Help us to see it in the smile of a stranger.&nbsp;A kind word from an acquaintance.&nbsp;A hug from a friend or family member.&nbsp;You know we are going to go through hard times but you also know who will be there in those moments when we need them.&nbsp;Help us to see them and let them help!&nbsp;Better yet help us notice&nbsp;opportunities to be the beauty in someone else’s life!&nbsp;Amen!”</em></strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</p>

      <title>Think About Such Things</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2021/6/21/think-about-such-things</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading</strong>:&nbsp; <em>Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable – if anything is excellent or praiseworthy – think about such things.”&nbsp; </em>Philippians 4:8</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have you ever found yourself in a place where your thoughts were just reeling around, and you can’t make them stop? &nbsp; Or maybe you notice the enemy has planted himself right in your mind. Maybe you’ve experienced a season of hurt, and the pain just won’t subside.&nbsp; Or maybe a fleeting thought gave way to a decision that might have lifelong repercussions.&nbsp; It may seem this season we have been in might intensify some of these situations.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I think we can all agree living in this pandemic has changed each of us in some way.&nbsp; Some ways we can see as beneficial and change for the better, and some we may see as “Yikes – was that really me who did, said, thought that”? &nbsp; Through these times, what I have learned more and more is that <span style="text-decoration:underline">we must choose each day to trust God</span>.&nbsp; I want to talk a moment about this verse from Philippians. This is a verse I read to my children a lot at the dinner table during their high school years, and it is one of my life verses. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I love this verse because it tells us what we are to think about.&nbsp; When we control what our mind thinks, we can then have better control over our actions. &nbsp; This verse does not suggest when we are in the mood to think about these things, or when everything is going right to think about such things, it says “think about such things”.&nbsp; It is a direct command.&nbsp; As I even take each word and think about what each one means, it gives us a deeper understanding of how God wants our minds to be filled.&nbsp; I just want to take a couple minutes and go a little deeper with each word.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">TRUE – real, genuine, sincere, integrity of character, or accurate.&nbsp; It is the opposite of dishonest and unreliable.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">NOBLE – possessing outstanding qualities, grand or impressive.&nbsp; Dignified and worth respect.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">RIGHT –just, good, proper, facts or truth, appropriate, conformity to God’s standards.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">PURE – not contaminated, sincere, not mixed with anything, spotless, moral or wholesome.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">LOVELY – pleasing and agreeable, delightful, beauty, harmony, grace.&nbsp; (only place in NT mentioned)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">ADMIRABLE – deserving the highest esteem, positive and constructive. (only place in NT mentioned)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">EXCELLENT – superior, over and above, beyond measure, exceeding greatness.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">PRAISEWORTHY – to express a favorable judgement, an expression of approval, to worship, to value.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Just to show us how easily we can get our thoughts out of alignment, I want us all to take a moment and remember what was in your thought process just this morning.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Were you thinking about what God’s word just described?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If we indeed follow this command, our mind and heart will be filled with what God desires for us, it is all for our benefit.&nbsp; He knows all our temptations and very well the world in which we live and how easily our thoughts can get off track and just spiral out of control.&nbsp; What we allow in our thoughts is up to us.&nbsp; God wants us to center our mind on all these things so we will become more and more like Him and be ready to receive all that God has for us in this life. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the book, It’s Not Supposed to Be This Way, Lisa Terkeurst says, “We must set our minds and our hearts on things above by choosing to remember God’s words, repeat God’s words, and believe God’s words about us.&nbsp; We must let God’s Word become the words we park our minds and hearts on.&nbsp; We must let God’s Word become the words we believe and receive as truth.&nbsp; We must let God’s Word become the words of our story.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Let’s let our minds be saturated with God and His truth today and remember: &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable – if anything is excellent or praiseworthy – think about such things.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>Heavenly Father, may we always look to you first for all things, no matter how big or small and believe and trust all that your word says.&nbsp; We are so thankful for the Bible and no matter our need; it has the answer.&nbsp; Thank you for being such a good and gracious God!!&nbsp; We love and adore you.&nbsp; In Jesus’ precious name, Amen.</em></strong></p>

      <title>She Sat By Him</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2021/7/21/she-sat-by-him</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading:</strong><em> “Surely You love the people; all the holy ones are in Your hand, and they sit down at Your feet; each receives Your words--”</em> (Deut. 33:3)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“She had a sister named Mary, who also sat at the Lord’s feet and was listening to what he said. ‘…but one thing is necessary. Mary has made the right choice, and it will not be taken away from her.’” </em>(Luke 10:39, 42)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“I do not call you servants any longer, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you [My] friends, because I have revealed to you everything that I have heard from My Father.”</em> (John 15:15 AMP)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“How do <em>you</em> spend time with Jesus, Dad?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Hmm, mainly prayer, I suppose. How about you?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The same, but sometimes I just imagine we’re throwing the baseball around.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is no sweeter insight into our son’s spiritual life for me. The Holy Spirit has revealed Jesus to my boy as his companion and champion. He’s worshipping Jesus by spending time with him in his mind, by practicing his presence in a way that is adoring to our Savior. Our son feels welcomed into a relationship with Jesus, rather than feeling he must do something to be in his presence.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We see this act of drawing near to Jesus in reverent friendship throughout scripture, but I am particularly drawn to the love between Mary, Martha, Lazarus, and Jesus. They were friends Jesus loved. John 11:5 (NIV) tells us, <em>“Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.”</em> These siblings lived together in Bethany near Jerusalem where Jesus would visit in their home. They were like family to him.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I especially enjoy how Mary enjoyed Jesus’ company. In Luke 10:40, we see that Mary left her sister and their hostess duties to jump at the chance to listen to Jesus teach while he was visiting. <em>“She had a sister named Mary, who seated herself at the Lord’s feet and was continually listening to His teaching”</em> (Luke 10:39 AMP). Mary clung to Jesus’ every word and felt welcomed by this family-friend to leave her responsibilities and enjoy his company, at ease, listening and learning like the other disciples - an unusual circumstance for an ancient Middle Eastern woman. Can you imagine her sense of awe as Jesus unveiled His Father’s love through scripture and the peaceful authority that emanated from him? The joy that must have filled Mary’s heart as he assured her frustrated sister,<em> “There is only one thing worth being concerned about. Mary has discovered it, and it will not be taken away from her” </em>(Luke 10:42 NLT).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s not coincidental that in the very next paragraph we learn from Jesus how to pray. He teaches us to draw near in prayer as his friend, as a child boldly asking for what we need. Notice these illustrations are mentioned after the adoring example of Mary who did not <em>work</em> to get into the presence of Jesus. She sat by him as a beloved friend.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I want to encourage you to leave your responsibility for a minute and forget the expectations of others. In a posture of prayer sit yourself close to your most precious friend Jesus and enjoy his company. Imagine the love in his eyes as he welcomes you. Listen to what he may say to you. Spend time adoring Jesus and be loved by him. Like my son, the Holy Spirit may reveal Jesus to you in a very special way! This good thing will never be taken away from you because you are Jesus’ very own treasured friend and family.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>Heavenly Father, thank You for what your Word reveals about your desire for me. Please help me to be like Mary and come to You knowing that I am always eagerly welcomed. I ask for the gift of knowing Lord Jesus as my closest friend. In Jesus’ name, I pray. Amen.</em></strong></p>

      <title>Pray Without Ceasing</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading</strong>:&nbsp; “<em>Now He was telling them a parable to show that at all times they ought to pray and not to lose heart.”&nbsp; </em>Luke 18:1</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have you ever “lost heart” in praying?&nbsp; Perhaps you didn’t receive the answer you desired, or maybe just didn’t know <em>how</em> to pray or what to say to God in a particular situation, or you may have felt too emotional or sad to even find the energy to pray.&nbsp; Our church family has recently experienced a terrible tragedy in the loss of one of our dear young people, and it has been deeply felt by so many of us.&nbsp; But there is encouragement and truth to be found in God’s Word, and I’d like to share some of that encouragement with you. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">No sincere, heartfelt prayer from a Christian is ever wasted.</span>&nbsp; No matter what the outcome — something as precious to God as a prayer is never ever wasted.&nbsp; It is impossible in God’s economy.&nbsp; “My times are in Thy hands (Psalm 31:15a)”… God “knows the end from the beginning” (Isaiah 46:10), and He told us to PRAY.&nbsp; Psalm 139 says that God knows every day of our life, before we have lived one of them.&nbsp; We have NO IDEA how our prayers are used; not the fullness of it anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp; If God saw our prayers as “wasted”, He wouldn’t prompt us — individually and collectively — to pray so much.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The truth is that our prayers are a sweet aroma before God (Revelation 5:8), and when we pray, we are being <em>obedient</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">“Now in the same way the Spirit also helps us in our weakness; for we do not know what to pray for as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.” (Romans 8:26)</span>.&nbsp; I’ve experienced moments when I am absolutely overwhelmed with grief, and I cry out to God, and it feels like the Holy Spirit is actually grieving through me.&nbsp; Just like Romans 8:26, the Holy Spirit can pray through people; and I think the Spirit can use anyone.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have you ever awakened during the night with a strong impression to pray for someone?&nbsp; I wonder if in those moments when we are overcome with anguish and tears — maybe God somehow lets us bear a small piece of their burden.&nbsp; It’s almost like a little bit of their pain can roll over onto us, when we cry out on their behalf.&nbsp; I believe that such prompting is from the Spirit of God; and we are standing in the gap for them, with groaning too deep for words… that we are lifting them up so that they can have grace and strength for the moment.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">God honors our tears</span>.&nbsp; Travail is a particular kind of prayer. It is an intense type of intercession; so intense that the apostle Paul compared it to the pangs of childbirth (Galatians 4:19).&nbsp; It’s very emotional, often tearful, and sometimes wordless. It can be quiet or loud; God hears it all. Those tears are a language that God understands well, and those TEARS are PRAYERS.&nbsp; No tear is ever wasted, just as no prayer is ever wasted!&nbsp; In Psalm 56:8 we read that God keeps our tears in His bottle; that’s how precious they are to God!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We are promised, however, in Revelation 21:4 that “He [God] will wipe every tear from their eyes”, and there will be no more mourning or crying or pain….”&nbsp; It’s not just that we won’t cry anymore, it’s better than that.&nbsp; God Himself will tenderly wipe our tears away – and somehow we will know that those are the last tears we will ever cry, for all of eternity!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We are told in 1 Thessalonians to “Rejoice always; pray without ceasing, and in everything give thanks; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.”&nbsp; May it ever be so, in Jesus’ name!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>O Lord, grant us grace and courage to come to You always in prayer, knowing that You&nbsp;are a God of great mercy and love, and You always know what’s best. Help us to trust in Your wisdom and embrace Your perfect will for our lives and the lives of others.&nbsp; In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></strong></p>

      <title>In-Between</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2022/1/28/in-between</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading:</strong> “And God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light.”&nbsp; (Genesis 1:3 NIV)“There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light.” (Revelation 22:5 NIV)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">From Genesis 1 to Revelation 22, there is light… and in-between, there is darkness.&nbsp; Sin. Sickness. Death. Sin. Fear. Pain. Sin. Suffering. War. Sin. Depression. Heartache. More Sin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We live in that “In-Between,” in a darkened world affected by mankind’s sin and its ramifications. Some days, we don’t feel it so deeply, so harshly.&nbsp; Moments of joy flicker like a candle, igniting hope. Other days, like lava, the darkness flows over our souls, destroying everything in its path, leaving only pain and gray ash.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I lay in the darkened hospital room, pregnant, with the very real possibility that my leg would be amputated below the knee, completely overwhelmed by the “In-Between.” Would my unborn baby survive? Would I? Fear. Pain. Heartache. The murky pall of helplessness shrouded me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Yet, just as volcanic ash leaves the ground more fertile, the ashes of suffering create a rich soul-soil for faith’s seeds. In that darkness, I slowly began to internalize the truths of Psalm 18:28, “You, LORD, keep my lamp burning; my God turns my darkness into light;” and of John 8:12, where Jesus declared, ‘I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.’”&nbsp; In that darkness, I began to reach for that light as a seedling reaches toward the sun, germinating in its light. In that darkness, I began to reach toward the Son and grow in the Light of my Savior, my Jesus.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One day, miraculously, the Lord sparked a tiny insight - insight that I never could have guessed and even the doctor hadn’t perceived - insight that made all the difference - saving both my leg and my baby. As God blew on that spark, a faith flame ignited, bringing light and life. Only later would I realize just how brightly that Light had illuminated my situation, for it was through this experience that an underlying health condition was revealed; which, if undetected, would have killed me. Once again, God “Romans 8:28-ed” a dark and devastating situation, as He has for me over and again since then.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Light of the World, Who is with God in Genesis and in Revelation, also permeates the “In-Between.”&nbsp; We see Him in every book of the Bible, and, when we look, in every dark “In-Between” of our lives.&nbsp; When the darkness is overwhelming, “He is the lamp to our feet and the light to our path” (Psalm 119:105) and when circumstances try to snuff out the light, “The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it” (John 1:5.)&nbsp; In speaking of God’s faithfulness and the reliability of Scripture, C.H. Spurgeon declared, “In your darkest hour, you may have no candle but a single promise, and yet that lone light shall make high noon of your midnight.”&nbsp; It is true. I have found it unfailingly to be so. May you find it so as well, as you seek Him in the “In-Between”.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>Lord, thank you for being our Light in the darkness of the “In-Between.”&nbsp; May we bask in Your Light as we seek You in Scripture, in prayer, and in obedience to Your Word. Let the Light of Your Truth shine in us to a darkened world, that You might get all the glory and honor.&nbsp; In Jesus’ holy, precious Name, Amen!</em></strong></p>

      <title>A Life Without Want</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2022/10/25/v90yahhnwkr5mkmu6cpvjwl8cdq7hk</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c1a639f506fbe5304403734/1666713732149-L615GWJKBLNCXSR1I0CP/unsplash-image-YjVa-F9P9kk.jpg?format=original" alt=""/>
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><br>A Life Without Want</strong><br></h1><h3 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. Psalm 23:1</em></h3><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Most of my business career, I was in the relentless pursuit of “want”.&nbsp; Whether it was the want of money, status, or some milestone of success, my life was oriented toward achievement.&nbsp; Every morning, I woke up and aligned my calendar with my wants.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> At the end of the day, I would look back and ask, “Did I make progress, am I any closer to achieving what <em>I </em>want?”&nbsp; Whether I checked everything off my list that day or not, I was still feeling dissatisfied– I didn’t have the time to do everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In my mind, if I could reach the next level, I could be content, slow down, and enjoy the process.&nbsp; However, as my career progressed and I started to achieve some of my wants, I was becoming less satisfied, less content. To offset the discontentment, I would speed up and push harder, climb faster.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Stephen Covey, author of the book 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, once wrote, </p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“If the ladder is not leaning against the right wall, every step we take just gets us to the wrong place faster.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I eventually reached a point in my career where I realized my ladder was on the wrong wall. No matter how high I climbed, there was going to be emptiness at the top.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">While I had read all the books on success in pursuit of contentment, I had brushed over how Jesus defined a content life.&nbsp;Simply put, Jesus said to live a life characterized by contentment, we just need to love God, and love people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><blockquote><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>&nbsp;“‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment.</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’&nbsp; - Matthew 22: 37-40&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In reality, my wants were defined by the world’s definition of success. However, when I began to reorient toward Jesus’s definition of “success”, I realized my yearning for success was actually an innate desire from God to be in relationship with him. Or put another way, when my  wants began to align with His wants, peace began to reign in my life. Striving began to diminish. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In John 14:27, Jesus says,</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I love that part, “my peace”. That is not a peace that you can buy or achieve.&nbsp;That’s a peace we receive, as believers in Christ, from <em>El Shaddai</em>— the all sufficient God— the God that is from eternity to eternity. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As I think about climbing my ladder on the wrong wall, I think of Jesus being at the bottom.&nbsp; Patiently waiting. I wonder if He ever says, “Look at him go, he is really up there. He really thinks he has it figured out this time.”&nbsp;Or as the good shepherd, does he have to come up the ladder and guide me back down and help me move the ladder to his wall?&nbsp;</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> John 10:14-16 is so powerful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>“I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me— just as the Father knows me and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for the sheep. </em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.”</em></p></blockquote><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I know my sheep”.&nbsp; The good shepherd knows me! He knows what I want and He gives me His peace freely, if I am willing to accept it and keep the ladder on His wall.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">(By the way, doesn’t verse 16 make you want to get your hands dirty for the Kingdom? “I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also.”)<br><br>A central part of John 10:14 is “and my sheep know me.” It could arguably be read as a directive.&nbsp;“You need to know me as I know you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How do we know him?&nbsp; We fix our eyes on Him.&nbsp;We spend time with Him daily, without fail.&nbsp; We talk with Him. We trust Him with our finances, our careers, our families. We stop moving and we listen. </p><blockquote><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>“Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is — his good, pleasing and perfect will.”&nbsp;  —Romans 12:2</em></p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is the key to a life without want, that we fix our minds on Christ– our Good Shepherd, who gives us <em>His</em> peace without restraint.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Chip Measells</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Executive Director &amp; Legacy Team Leader</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Point Church </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br><br><br></p>

      <title>Faith Draws God’s Attention&amp;nbsp;</title>

  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br>Faith Draws God’s Attention</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I went to Bethlehem once. It’s still hard for me to believe! I rode in a comfy tour bus over the hills that Jesus’ ancestors once walked. I remember imagining these heroes of faith as we rolled past modern scenes. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Rachel being buried near the road to Bethlehem. Ruth gleaning in the fields and meeting Boaz. David shepherding his sheep and being anointed King too.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My heart raced a bit as our bus stopped at a checkpoint on the West Bank. Would we be welcome? Mary and Joseph had anxiously looked for welcome in this city. As we crossed into the location of the greatest miracle in history, all I could think of was “Jesus was born right here!”&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God who controls history determined Jesus to be born in this obscure village, but why? The quick answer: to fulfill His prophecy (Micah 5:2) as echoed in the gospels. Yet, long before Micah declared this Word of the Lord, God intricately prepared a message that only this ancient town can preach. It’s a message about faith and it begins with the first mention of Bethlehem in scripture.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This first mention found in Genesis 35:19 explains that Rachel, who was Jesus’ great-grandmother many times over, was buried along the road near Bethlehem. This is the same road that God’s people would follow into exile centuries later.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tradition tells us that they would stop near Bethlehem at Rachel’s grave to pray for salvation. They had faith God would keep His promise to return them to their homeland. (Jeremiah 31:14-16; Matt. 2:18)&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. This is what the ancients were commended for.” Hebrews 11:1-2</p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God did return His people to their promised land, yet even more so, <em>“when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son…” </em>(Galatians 4:4) God answered their faith-filled prayers for salvation beyond even what they hoped. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus the Messiah could have been born anywhere He&nbsp;chose, but perhaps He was drawn to Bethlehem due to the generations of faith-filled believers and prayers in that location.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“And without faith, it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.” </em>(Hebrews 11:6) </p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Are you believing God when you draw near to Him? Do you pray confidently knowing that the Lord hears you? </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Allow the history of God’s responsiveness to energize your prayers and be assured that your faith is drawing your Heavenly Father’s attention!&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">PRAYER&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father God, thank You for that because of Christ and my faith in him, I can now come boldly and confidently into Your presence. Please help me to grow my faith in You. Thank You that You hear my prayers and respond to me.</p><p style="text-align:right;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><br><br>Written by Kristin Fields </p>

      <title>The Gift of Hope</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2022/12/1/the-gift-of-hope</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">An Advent Devotional </p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>What do you hope for this Christmas?</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I remember when I was seven years old hoping to receive a magic wand. These days I tend to be a little more practical. Yet even in my attempt to shape the ideal Christmas into reality, the gifts, gatherings, and glee can fail to fulfill my hope.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s a great reminder that the Lord has not promised to fulfill my hope through a cheery holiday season. He has promised to fulfill my hope through His presence.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Therefore repent and turn back, so that your sins may be wiped out, that </em><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>seasons of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord.</em></span><em>”</em> (Acts 3:19-20)&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christian hope is not a lofty idea floating untethered to reality. Our hope is rooted in history—  the history of God’s gift giving. We’ve been given the gift of Jesus Christ and his incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. We’ve been given Christ’s ascension and heavenly reign, the Holy Spirit’s indwelling, the canon of New Testament scripture, and Jesus’ current intercession. He has given us lasting purpose and the community of the Church. These gifts fulfill scripture and are evidence of hope fulfilled.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<figure class="block-animation-none">
  <blockquote data-animation-role="quote"
  >
    <span>“</span>The reality is God has given us even more gifts that have yet to be opened. That is the thrill of hope! <span>”</span>
  </blockquote>
  
</figure>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One day our Heavenly Father will surprise us by opening these gifts. The tearing of paper will be accompanied by a trumpeted pronouncement that King Jesus is coming. Out of this glorious surprise will come the end of all suffering and evil. New heavens and a new earth will emerge to our great delight. We will be given immortal bodies and the faithful in Christ will be rewarded. We will enter Jesus’ joy and experience the fullness of His presence face to face. It will be an unimaginable, unending celebration!&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is the hope on which we get to confidently set our expectations.</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.” </em>(Heb. 10:23)</p></blockquote><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">PRAYER</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank you that one of your many good gifts to me is hope. This Christmas as I celebrate Jesus Christ’s first coming, I set my hope on the grace given to me when He comes again. Thank you for the incredible gifts I have as your child. In Jesus’ mighty name I pray, amen.</p><p style="text-align:right;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><br><br></p><p style="text-align:right;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">Written by Kristin Fields </p>

      <title>Prince of Peace</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2022/12/21/prince-of-peace</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prince of Peace</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.” </em>(Isaiah 9:6)</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br>I’m convinced God enjoys naming things.</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> From the beginning of the Bible, we read God named humankind His image-bearers. Throughout scripture, He repeatedly renamed people to mirror their character and purpose. Names are a big deal to God. Considering God inspired the titles reflective of His one and only Son’s nature, we are wise to pay attention to them.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So in this chaotic world, what does it mean that Jesus is the Prince of Peace?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It reveals we are incapable of creating our own peace. Jesus as the Prince of Peace implies that peace belongs to him and it’s his alone to bestow.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Do you recall how Jesus slept in a fishing boat in the middle of a furious storm (see Matthew 8:23-27)?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus rebuked the wind and the waves, and then there was complete calm and peace. In the midst of that fear and chaos, Jesus made himself known to his disciples as the Prince of Peace.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus has not ceased caring for and revealing himself to those who follow him. Jesus said, “Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.” (John 14:21) Other translations use the words reveal, show; the Amplified Bible translation says, <em>“I will make Myself real to him.”</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On the evening of that raging storm, the disciples perhaps overlooked who was with them. Let's be different in this regard by the power of the Holy Spirit. Ask God for grace to remember that He is your constant companion and yield to His leading. Obey. In return, He will reveal His presence with you, and life’s undercurrent will grow increasingly tranquil despite circumstances.</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you. Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you.” </em>(John 14:26-27)</p></blockquote><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">PRAYER</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Glorious Father, thank You for adopting me as your child and renaming me “Beloved” (Romans 9:25). Thank You that because of Jesus my Savior I can experience true peace. I ask for the grace to remember Your presence with me and grace to obey. Please help me to experience the peace that comes from You. Amen.</p>

      <title>The Bigger Picture</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2022/3/3/the-bigger-picture</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading:</strong> “We can make our plans, but the Lord determines our steps (Proverbs 16:9, <em>NLT</em>).”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have you ever been asked the question, “Where do you see yourself in ____ years?” Are you actually where you thought you would be ____ years ago?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you had asked me that question however many years ago I would have told you that I would be working a job that I loved, making enough money to live comfortably. I would be married, with at least one child (hopefully more), a dog or two (maybe a cat) in a nice house. Nothing wrong with this right? Of course not!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Am I there… NOPE! I have a job that I love but no husband, no children, no pets, no home of my own. When you grow up being told you are worthless, stupid, ugly, fat and so many other negaitive things this can send you to a very dark place – and it did. I honestly believed that the reason I didn’t get these things was because the cruel things I was told as I was growing up were true. And because I believed this, I made some bad choices and tried to put a wall up between myself, God and everyone else, because they all must believe this about me, too. This just helped with the downward spiral of loneliness and negativity. I had good days but there were so many more bad days. I wasn’t sure I would ever get out of the hole I felt I was in. My “human” heart told me that my plans didn’t work out because there was something wrong with me. My “Jesus” heart reminded me that there is a reason things did not work out the way I planned them.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You know what I love about God? He can use the simplest of things to teach you the biggest lessons. While organizing the donated school supplies into piles of like items and then into separate piles for each school we were supporting, He made things make sense in such a real way. What I thought was only going to take an hour or two took almost 9 hours! I would get one item organized and felt a sense of accomplishment only to stand up and see all of the other items waiting to be sorted. It was very overwhelming and discouraging; but as frustrated as I was, I realized that if I had just focused on where I was and not worried about what was next it wouldn’t have been so overwhelming and discouraging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s the same way with our plans. We aren’t meant to worry about what is next. It would overwhelm us too much. Instead, the Bible shows us that our God is not only ever-present but that He supplies our every need (Matthew 6:33-34). The Lord promised to never leave nor forsake the Israelites in Deuteronomy 31 – and He makes the same promise to us today. So, with every plan that you and I make, we can trust that God is walking with us every step of the way, determining our steps according to His goodness.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>God, help us to be content with where you have us now but still excited about what’s to come. Your plans are so much more amazing than anything we can plan for ourselves, so help us to trust in obedience that Your ways are higher than our ways. Give us strength as we wait on You!&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

      <title>The Object of Faith</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2022/4/22/the-object-of-faith</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture Reading</strong>:&nbsp; “For she thought, ‘If I just touch the hem of His garment, I shall get well.’&nbsp; And immediately . . . she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.” (Mark 5:28-29)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Growing up, our family enjoyed watching the popular television series Superman; however, my younger brother was particularly keen. He begged for his own Superman cape – and finally my mother took an old bath towel, drew a giant “S” on it, and tied it around his neck.&nbsp; Moments later, as she was washing dishes, she spotted my brother “flying” past the kitchen window in a rapid descent to the ground, from the roof – his “cape” barely flapping in the breeze! It must have made perfect sense to him: he loved Superman. And, as the child that he was, he put all his faith in that cape – believing it would let him fly.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In today’s story (see Mark 25-34), this woman exhibited tremendous faith. Having had a hemorrhage for 12 years, she was not only physically ill, but according to Levitical law was marked as unclean: a social outcast. Can you imagine her loneliness and desperation to be made well? But, “after hearing about Jesus,” her faith in Him was ignited – a faith so strong and sure that her healing came about before Jesus even saw her or touched her. Reaching out, she literally tapped into his power and mercy. Even Jesus confirmed that it was her <span style="text-decoration:underline">faith</span> that had made her well (v. 34): faith in HIM!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Let’s look briefly at the kind of faith the woman had in our story:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. Her faith was <em>bold</em>. She muscled her way through the crowd, in spite of her situation in life, and did whatever she had to do in order to access Jesus – her only hope.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. Her faith was <em>focused</em>. She wanted Jesus and no other and refused to be distracted or deterred from her goal. She didn’t care about the consequences.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">3. Her faith was <em>humble</em>. It’s interesting that she positioned herself to touch the hem, or bottom part of the garment, near Jesus’ feet. This means she bowed not before him, but behind him – the ultimate expression of humility.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">4. Her faith was <em>expectant</em>. She thought (believed), “If I just touch the hem of His garment, <span style="text-decoration:underline">I shall get well</span>.” No doubts, no ifs or maybes, but “I SHALL get well.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you’re like me, your faith is often less than bold, focused, humble, and expectant. But, God is able! He is able to increase our faith if we ask, and He loves to give good gifts to his children (Matt. 7:11). The gift of faith is one of his very best.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Let’s face it, this world offers us all kinds of super-heroes to trust and believe in, and most of them don’t fly around wearing capes! We can place our trust in people, institutions, ideologies, religion, finances, and accomplishments – but they cannot save.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Charles Spurgeon said it well, “What is the object of faith, then? It is a person, a living, divine, appointed person. And who is that person? He is none other than Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>Thank you, Lord, for your wonderful gift of faith. Help me to grow in that faith, becoming more certain of you each day, trusting in you alone with all my heart, reaching out to you and claiming your power and mercy, resting in your everlasting goodness and love. Amen.</em></strong></p>

      <title>Power of Prayer and Fasting&amp;nbsp;</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/1/10/power-of-prayer-and-fastingnbsp</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Power of Prayer and Fasting&nbsp;</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As we embark on a new year, it's a perfect time to reflect on the past and set our sights on the future. One thing that has always been a constant in my life, and has brought me great comfort and strength, is the power of prayer. Prayer is such a crucial part of our spiritual formation and it has the ability to transform our lives in immeasurable ways.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we pray, we are able to connect with God and seek His guidance and wisdom. James 1:5 tells us,</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> "If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you." </p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How amazing is that? God is always ready and willing to give us the wisdom and guidance we need, we just have to ask.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer is also a way for us to offer up our praise and thanksgiving to God. In Psalm 34:1, it says, </p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"I will extol the Lord at all times; his praise will always be on my lips." </p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we offer up our praise to God, it helps to shift our focus from our own problems and onto all that God has done for us. It's a reminder of His faithfulness and goodness.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But prayer isn't just about asking God for things or offering up our praise. It's also about seeking transformation in our own lives. In Philippians 4:6-7, it says, </p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." </p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we pray and present our requests to God, it helps to ease our anxiety and brings us a sense of peace.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer is such a powerful tool, and when we pray consistently, it can have a profound impact on our lives. But have you ever considered taking your prayer life to the next level through fasting? Fasting is a way to set aside physical pleasures and focus on seeking God. It's a way to humble ourselves before God and to put Him first in our lives.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In Matthew 6:16-18, it says, </p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you."</p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Fasting isn't about seeking attention or accolades from others, it's about seeking a deeper connection with God. When we fast, we are able to set aside the distractions of the world and focus on seeking God's will for our lives. It's a way to draw closer to Him and to seek His guidance and wisdom.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So as we embark on a new year, I encourage you to make prayer and fasting a priority.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Everything is better, and anything is possible, when we pray. Don't be afraid to bring your needs, your praise, and your requests to God. He is ready and willing to hear from you and to guide you on your journey.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Trust in Him and have faith that He will lead you down the path that is best for you.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br><br></p>

      <title>Prayer &amp;amp; The Word&amp;nbsp;</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/1/19/prayer-amp-the-wordnbsp</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer &amp; The Word&nbsp;</h1><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“This is the confidence we have before him: If we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. And if we know that he hears whatever we ask, we know that we have what we have asked of him.” </em>(1 John 5:14-15)&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I remember when my father would give guidance or a promise of some kind, I would often return to Him with the reminder, “Dad, you said…” God, who is the perfect parent, knows exactly what we need even before we ask, but as our Father He wants us to come to Him in complete dependence. We see this exemplified in Jesus’ life.&nbsp;</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer was central in Jesus’ life with God, second to none. </h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He made time for it and often stayed up all night praying. I find it fascinating as well that of all the things the disciples could ask Jesus to teach them to do, he was asked to teach them to pray (Luke 11:1)! If Jesus’ life revolved around communing and enjoying His Father in prayer and yielded such incredible Kingdom results, our lives are meant to as well.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Because of Christ’s sacrifice, you are invited to come boldly to God’s throne of grace with all sorts of prayers. We have been seated with Christ in the heavenly realms. We have been spiritually positioned in such a way that we have the gracious ear of God. And because God has no favorite children (Romans 2:11), you can be confident that He welcomes your company and conversation.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Timothy teaches that all scripture is God-breathed (2 Timothy 3:16). It is the inspired, life-giving, timeless revelation God intends for you - as if His words were just spoken directly to you. When we bring to our Heavenly Father what He has shared in scripture, it’s as if we are coming to Him saying, “Dad, you said…” When we pray like this we are agreeing with what He has revealed and spoken in alignment with His words, will, or example.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Here’s an example of how I pray God’s Word.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As I read my Bible, I write my children’s initials next to verses pertaining to the kind of character I desire for the Lord to grow in them. When I pray these scriptures, I am confident and expectant knowing that this is God’s heart for them as well.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, please <em>conform my children to the image of Your Son </em>(Romans 8:29). Jesus, I pray that they will <em>abide in You </em>(John 15:5) and <em>bear much fruit to Your glory </em>(Gal. 5:22-23). I pray they have <em>a different spirit and follow You fully </em>(Num. 14:24). Empower them to <em>live by Your Spirit and walk by Your Spirit </em>(Gal. 5:25). Father, please <em>increase my children in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man </em>just as Jesus grew (Luke 2:52).</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Praying scripture is powerful! </h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s a reminder to yourself and God of your dependency on Him to shape whatever you are asking in prayer. With a mouthful of His Words, your thoughts and motivations begin to harmonize with your Heavenly Father, and just like Jesus prayer becomes one of your greatest joys.&nbsp;</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:&nbsp;</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You for the gift of Your Word and Your Spirit which help me to pray according to Your will. I praise You for such an incredible privilege. Lord Jesus, teach ME how to pray! I love You. Amen.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p>

      <title>Prayer and Fasting</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/1/19/prayer-and-fasting</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer &amp; Fasting&nbsp;</h1><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer; you shall cry for help, and he will say, “Here I am…. The Lord will guide you continually” </em>(Isaiah 58:9, 11 NRSV)&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tools are pathways to infinite creativity. They have the potential when used to build, influence, and bring about something with lasting benefit. Jesus has passed on two spiritual power tools to those who choose to follow his example - fasting and praying. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus taught, <em>“When you fast…;” </em>implying his disciples would indeed fast and pray (Matthew 6:16). By putting these tools to use,&nbsp;we are led deeper into friendship with God who strengthens us and brings us into alignment with Him in order to continue the ministry of Christ and experience abundant life.&nbsp;</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A fast is a voluntary practice of setting aside food, a source of nourishment and pleasure, for the Source who loves you. </h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is guided by the genuine intention of drawing nearer to God with increased sensitivity. You are invited by the Lord to fast and pray for any reason within His will. A few common themes found in scripture are:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Repentance</span>: Bringing your body into submission through self-denial is a picture of your whole being turning away from disordered desires and toward your heavenly Father. In doing so you are fasting and praying to be released from spiritual bondage into His freedom. Seek God’s will and strength in order to align yourself with Him.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Renewal</span>: You may feel far from God, or you may encounter a wilderness season when God feels absent. Life may feel fruitless. Enter into a fast seeking God’s thoughts and feelings by desiring communion with Him. Pray for your heart to be softened, to experience His love, and to love Him in return.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reengagement</span>: Consider Jesus’ compassion for the lost, prodigal, sick, lonely, and marginalized. When lacking empathy for the things that break God’s heart, fast and pray to experience the Lord’s sorrow and become an active participant in His plan of redemption. Ask for a heart like His and seek His direction.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Relief</span>: Fasting can be a way to move through tidal waves of grief. Time set aside to feel your pain with God with fasting and prayer is a form of lament. Ask God to comfort and minister His compassion to you by sharing His thoughts, shifting you into greater intimacy with Him. To experience Jesus with you in your pain through fasting and prayer can be a catalyst for healing.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our reasons to fast are personal and numerous, but perhaps this brief list will help you identify the fast to which the Lord is calling you.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Whatever your reason may be, we are blessed to remember that by fasting and praying we are declaring mastery over our nature so that we will live directed by the <em>“power of the Spirit” </em>(Luke 10:21). What a thrill that we’ve been given spiritual power tools by the Master Creator, taught by Him, and invited into this powerful work with our Savior.&nbsp;</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lord Jesus, you are so generous! Thank you for hearing from me and receiving me. I chose to follow in your footsteps by fasting and praying that <em>“Your kingdom come. You will be done on earth </em>[and in me] <em>as it is in heaven.” </em>(Matt. 6:10) Amen.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p>

  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Baptism</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Many people come to faith in Christ at different points in their lives, and for some, the decision to be baptized may not have come right away. But regardless of when or where you accepted Christ, or whether you have been baptized before, we want to encourage you to consider taking this important step of going public with your faith through baptism.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Baptism is an outward expression of an inward decision to follow Jesus Christ.</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is a powerful symbol of new beginnings, and it marks the start of a journey of growing closer to God and becoming more like Him. In baptism, we publicly proclaim our faith in Jesus and the change He has made in our lives.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Bible is clear about the importance of baptism. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In Matthew 28:19, Jesus commands his followers to baptize others in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and in Acts 22:16, the Apostle Paul is told by Ananias "And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name." . So, baptism is not just a tradition, it is a command from our Lord, Jesus himself.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you have accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, but have never been baptized, we want you to know that <strong>you are not alone.</strong> There are many people in the same situation, and we would be honored to stand alongside you as you take this important step of faith. Being baptized is not just for new believers, it is for anyone who wants to publicly identify themselves with Jesus, regardless of their past.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Baptism is a powerful way to start your journey as a follower of Jesus.</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It marks the start of a new chapter in your life and is a powerful reminder of the change Jesus has made in you. As the Bible says,</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!" (2 Corinthians 5:17).</p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We would love to have the opportunity to stand with you as you go public with your faith. Let us know if you are ready to take the step of being baptized and we will be more than happy to help you make this decision! We believe that your baptism will be a day you will never forget, a moment that you will look back on with joy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We hope you will consider taking this step and going public with your faith through baptism.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p>

      <title>The Power of Prayer, Community and Confession</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/1/23/the-power-of-prayer-community-and-confession</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Power of Prayer, Community and Confession</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As believers, it's so important for us to make prayer, community, and confession a part of our daily lives. These practices have the power to transform us and to guide us on our journey with God. In this blog, I want to talk about the importance of returning to these disciplines and how they can help us grow closer to God.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">First, let's talk about the importance of<strong> prayer.</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer is a way for us to connect with God and to seek His guidance and wisdom. In Philippians 4:6-7, it says,</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." </p></blockquote><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we pray, it helps to ease our anxiety and brings us a sense of peace.</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But sometimes, we can get undisciplined in our prayer lives. We get busy with the demands of life and we let our prayer time slip away. That's why it's so important to make a conscious effort to return to the discipline of prayer. Set aside a specific time each day to pray and make it a priority. It could be first thing in the morning, before you go to bed, or any time that works for you. The important thing is to be consistent and to make it a part of your daily routine.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Another important discipline is <strong>community</strong>. We were not meant to journey through life alone. In Ecclesiastes 4:9-10, it says, </p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up." </p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we have a community of believers around us, it helps to lift us up and to encourage us when we're facing challenges. It also helps to hold us accountable and to help us grow in our faith.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But just like with prayer, it's easy to get undisciplined in our relationships with our community of believers. We may not make time for fellowship or we may neglect our relationships with others. That's why it's so important to make a conscious effort to return to the discipline of community. Make time for fellowship, either through small groups or one-on-one relationships. And don't be afraid to be vulnerable with others. When we open up and share our struggles and our victories, it helps to build deeper connections and to encourage one another in our faith.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Finally, let's talk about the importance of<strong> confession.</strong> </h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We all sin and we all fall short of God's perfect standard. But when we confess our sin and turn away from it, it helps to restore our relationship with God. In 1 John 1:9, it says, </p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness." </p></blockquote><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Confession is a crucial part of our spiritual growth and it helps to keep us close to God.</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But just like with prayer and community, it's easy to get undisciplined in our confession. We may try to hide our sin or we may try to justify it. But it's so important to return to the discipline of confession. When we confess our sin, it helps to keep us humble and it helps to keep us close to God. It's not about trying to earn God's forgiveness, it's about recognizing our need for it and seeking it out.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So as you embark on a new year, I encourage you to make prayer, community, and confession a priority. We've all grown undisciplined in these areas at some point, but it's never too late to return to them. </p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Trust in God and have faith that He will use these disciplines to transform you and to guide you on your journey with Him.</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p>

      <title>Prayer and Confession</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/1/30/prayer-and-confession</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer &amp; Confession&nbsp;</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A decade ago, I shared with a trusted friend the temptation and skewed thinking I was battling. It was a slippery slope, and I was miserable. I don’t recall the details of the conversation, but my friend listened and her response was compassionate; without a doubt she prayed.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What I know for certain is that I was invited to meet with her in a weekly small group to pray and read 1 John. This spiritual mother led me to the Word that ultimately renewed my broken mind. That is the power of confession in Christian community. Since then, I have learned to keep a short account with God through daily confession in prayer, and if necessary, in Christian community for support.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Like Adam and Eve, we have the freedom to hide our sin and our weaknesses. However, we also have the freedom to confess, bringing our struggles into the healing light of Christ. When we confess our sin to God we are forgiven, cleansed, and given a fresh start.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” </em>(1 John 1:9)&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Confession is asking Christ to wash us clean, not wallowing in shame and condemnation. It’s running to God and it’s good news.&nbsp;</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Keep in mind, our battle with temptation is more like a war than a skirmish. Believing God is not withholding something good from you can be a challenge. This is when we wish there was an easy way out, but you were not made for easy. You were made for intimacy; intimacy with God and intimacy within the family of God. Engaging in Christian community through prayer and confession is vital to living a dynamic life with Christ.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Years ago I read an account of an African tribe that would surround a guilty person and proceed to remind them of who they are apart from their mistake. They were cared for and known. I imagine our Heavenly Father, who gives only good things, may have something like this in mind for Christian community.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In His mercy, God has provided believers prepared to remind you that you are no longer a sinner, but a saint with the capacity to sin. The loving truth of who you are in Christ and this sense of belonging is available where Christ dwells through His Spirit.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“For where two or three are gathered together in my name, I am there among them.” </em>(Matthew 18:20)&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am eternally thankful for the freedom the Lord provided for me through prayer, scripture, and fellow believers. If you are wrestling with darkness, please know you are not alone and freedom is God’s intention for you as well.&nbsp;</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer:&nbsp;</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, I surrender to You not in defeat, but in victory knowing that You are for me, not against me. Please call to mind where I am not following You that I may confess and agree with You. Please lead me to my next step. In Jesus’ name I pray, amen.</p>

  <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>"Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;of hosts.&nbsp;Who are you,&nbsp;O great mountain? Before&nbsp;Zerubbabel&nbsp;you shall become a plain. And he shall bring forward&nbsp;the top stone amid shouts of ‘Grace, grace to it!’” </em>(Zechariah 4:6-7)</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">An angel foretold that Zerubbabel would complete his enormous rebuilding assignment with shouts of God's people recognizing the blessing. <em>"...And he shall bring forward&nbsp;the top stone amid shouts of ‘Grace, grace to it!’” </em>(Zec. 4:7)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Believer, you have been grafted into this same family&nbsp;of God where all of His promises have been fulfilled in Christ (2 Corinthians 1:20). Imagine angels shouting, "Grace! Grace to you," as you work with the Holy Spirit to fulfill your calling. Heaven clearly recognizes God’s gift to you:&nbsp;<em>"the immeasurable riches of His grace" </em>(Ephesians 2:7) available to you through prayer and holy dependence.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In Christ you have...</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. saving grace establishing you in a close relationship with your Creator (Romans 5:9).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. justifying grace clothing you in Christ's righteousness as if you never sinned (Romans 3:24, Zec. 3:4-5).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">3. teaching grace training you to live as God intended in order to bless your life and others (Titus 2:12).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">4. enabling grace supplying supernatural empowerment to know and do God's will regardless of your weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Grace reveals God’s power and presence on the earth so that no one can miss Him, especially you.&nbsp;Give yourself and your plans to Him daily and see the evidence of His Spirit moving in your life. God loves humble, insignificant beginnings as much as He loves glorious conclusions.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reflection</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. Recall a time you found depending on the Holy Spirit and His grace more effective than might and power.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. What has God called you to do that you need to finish? What does He want you to begin?</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father God, out of Your goodness You have established me in Christ through faith. Thank You! Your grace is awesome, and I surrender my life to You again. I ask the Holy Spirit to fill me and for an outpouring of Your grace. It is in the holy name of Jesus Christ that I pray; amen.</p>

      <title>An Everlasting Kingdom</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/10/4/an-everlasting-kingdom</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Scripture:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”</em> (Revelation 21:3-4)</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Reading:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I read the text again.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Years ago my friend and I spent Thursday mornings in a Bible study, followed by lunches with our kids and a load of cut grapes, excited about what we were learning. It seems as though she was just leaning against my countertop, warm smile and easy laugh.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This past Sunday in church our congregation sang, “How I long to breathe the air of heaven where pain is gone, and mercy fills the street.” (“Hymn of Heaven,” Phil Wickham) My insides felt like they were on fire and tears followed suit to quench the pain.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I read the text again. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I thought about my friend, a runner, racing into the embrace of Jesus, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom (Daniel 4:3). How she joined the chorus of heaven singing praise to God for His deliverance and rescue. <em>“For he is the living God and he endures forever; his kingdom will not be destroyed, his dominion will never end. He rescues and he saves…”</em> (Dan. 6:26-27)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“But at that time your people—everyone whose name is found written in the book—will be delivered. Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt.”</em> (Dan. 12:1-2)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I read His text again. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our suffering will be incomparable to what Jesus Christ has in store for those who love Him. <em>“For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us.”</em> (Romans 8:18) My friend chose to put her faith in Christ. According to holy scripture, she is experiencing the majesty and joy of God’s presence.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“As for you, go your way till the end. You will rest, and then at the end of the days you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance.”</em> (Dan. 12:13)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I read His text again.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Some things on our timelines we will never understand, yet God helps us understand the way to everlasting life. He sent His Son Jesus the first time to save us, and His text says Jesus will return to make all things right! In His kingdom there will be no more death, no more heartbreak (1 Corinthians 15:24-26). Until that day, let’s read His text again.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Reflection:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What verses minister God’s peace and truth to me in the face of devastating news? Have I equipped myself with scripture for trying days?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Daniel 11:33 and 12:3 “the wise” are busy making disciples. How can I turn my attention to others and influence them to turn to Christ?</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father God, I look forward to the day when Your kingdom has come, and Christ has completed Your will on earth as it is in heaven. I ask for Your unconditional grace until the day I enter into the fulness of Your presence. Thank You, Lord Jesus. Amen.</p>

      <title>Family Stories</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/11/1/family-stories</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Give ear, O my people, to my teaching; incline your ears to the words of my mouth! I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings from of old, things that we have heard and known, that our fathers have told us. We will not hide them from their children, but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the Lord, and his might, and the wonders that he has done.” (Psalm 78:1-4)</em></p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I love family history. My grandparents had a box that held bits and pieces of newspaper clippings and souvenirs; evidence of decades and centuries past. Family stories shape our identities like underground boulders poking through the surface, reminding us of the shoulders on which we stand.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Within my family history, the spiritual testimonies fascinate me. I see how these God-stories pass the gospel message from one generation to another. Today by God’s grace, you and I are creating a similar spiritual inheritance by following Christ as Lord.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">From one generation to the next, God intends for faith to flow. Paul wrote to Timothy, <em>“I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells in you as well.”</em>  (2 Timothy 1:5)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is our job to share the gospel as well as <em>“the glorious deeds of the Lord, and his might, and the wonders he has done” in our lives</em> (Ps. 78:4). The next generation needs the evidence of our testimonies.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What has more eternal value than sharing the gospel and the testimony of your history with Christ as Lord? If you take a passive stance assuming someone will do this for you, likely your spiritual inheritance will not be passed onto the next generation. The riches of your story will end with you.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You may or may not have the gift of knowing your family’s spiritual stories, but if you trust Christ as your Savior, you have the “sincere faith” Paul wrote about to Timothy. The Lord has been at work in your life from the beginning as well. You are a part of God’s family, and your story is His evidence to the next generation.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reflect</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1.&nbsp;What are a few ways you can pass your God-story onto the next generation? </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2.&nbsp;Ask the Holy Spirit to guide you into conversations where the gospel and the wonder of knowing Jesus Christ may be shared.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You for bringing me into Your family. Thank You for the story of Your exceeding goodness in my life. Please show me how to pass the gospel and my testimony to the next generation as their spiritual inheritance. In Jesus Christ’s saving name, I pray. Amen.</p>

      <title>Celebrate</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/11/21/celebrate</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>"And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and&nbsp;ran and&nbsp;embraced him and&nbsp;kissed him.&nbsp;And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.&nbsp;I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’&nbsp;But the father said to his servants,&nbsp;‘Bring quickly&nbsp;the best robe, and put it on him, and put&nbsp;a ring on his hand, and&nbsp;shoes on his feet.&nbsp;And bring&nbsp;the fattened calf and kill it, and&nbsp;let us eat and celebrate." (Luke 15:20-23)</em></p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Is God thankful? God is Creator and Sustainer of all things, so for what would He be thankful?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In Luke 15, the lost sheep, the lost coin, the lost son represent you. God is represented by the shepherd, the woman, and the father, who are not content moving on with&nbsp;the other ninety-nine sheep, the other nine coins, and the other son, until what was lost is found. These lost things are valuable to the owners.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”</em> (Luke 19:10) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To be separate from God is not only reckless, but it also equates death. There is no hope for spiritual safety. <em>"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."</em> (Romans 6:23) The consequence of disregarding God is eventual spiritual starvation; slowly living to die. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God honors our choice even if we are determined to wander off to a "far country." I know from personal experience that such insane thinking inevitably leads to soul sickness: feeling unworthy, alone, lost. Jesus said,&nbsp;<em>“It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”</em> (Luke 5:31-32) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is how God brings us home to Himself. <em>"And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him."</em> (Luke 15:20) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With a passionate mix of love and pity, the Lord Jesus covers the chasm we cannot and races to cover sin-slicked people with Himself. He clothes us with the best robe, His robe of righteousness (Isaiah 61:10). He cuts off any plea we may have prepared and instead calls for a celebratory feast, a feast of thankfulness.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You see, <em>“...for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.’”</em> (Luke 15:24) Can you imagine this realization? The unrestrained love, elation, and thankfulness the Lord feels over every person restored safe and sound to Him. It is no wonder <em>“…there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”</em> (Luke 15:10)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus pleads with us, the rebellious and the religious, to respond, to return, to reconcile to the Father. God looks for you so that He may affirm your worth and value, because He is where you rightfully belong. God is exorbitantly thankful for you, beloved one.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Application</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintain a daily time of reflection and repentance. You will experience increased freedom from sin and peace as a result.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is God revealing about His thoughts and actions toward you in Luke 15? Visualize what He reveals.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father God, Your extravagant love for me is beyond all reasoning! I celebrate You with a heart full of thankfulness. Your Word says that You are acquainted with all my ways, and that You will never leave me nor forsake me. Thank You! Holy Spirit, please lead me to repent of any sin keeping me from experiencing my Heavenly Father’s embrace. It is in Jesus Christ’s name that I pray. Amen.</p>

      <title>Light</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/12/21/light</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Scripture:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.”</em> (John 1:4-5)</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Reading:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My family stood at the pitch-black entrance. The gaping hole of an abandoned railroad tunnel open to us like a hungry mouth. My grandmother’s words echoed in my mind. “You’re brave. It’s awfully dark in there!” Stepping into that cold void, I understood what she meant.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We continued to follow the track as far as we could before breaking out a flashlight. Its brilliance instantly filled our surrounding space. We wised up and began walking in the light – secure and at peace.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, ‘I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.’”</em> (John 8:12)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When Jesus declared Himself the light of the world, he was referring to Old Testament metaphors that describe the Messiah as light (Psalm 84:11, Malachi 4:2). Jesus the Messiah came as the glory of His Jewish people as well as the light of the world.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Just as the sun shines in more than one spot, on more than one nation, so does the Lord revealing the way to a saving relationship with God. He cannot be confined. He will never be extinguished. He is the living God who makes Himself known to those willing to see.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>As Jesus said, “If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him."</em> (John 11:9-1-0)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus Christ, the Source of spiritual light, gives Himself as our constant guide. Yet, we can be tempted to anxiously grasp in the darkness, groping for what does not exist – abundant life and peace apart from God.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Consider again the message of Christmas. The baby in the manger grew to be the light of mankind. Christ continues to invite all to become children of light, children of the day (1 Thessalonians 5:5). It is an invitation to live as He did, obeying our Heavenly Father in the light of His love.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ask Christ to reveal His light to you, your family, your community. Walk in His light – secure and at peace. </p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Application:</h2><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Soak in the light of scripture. Allow the above passages to play over and over in your mind.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You walk in the light by obeying God (1 John 3:18–19, 24). Ask the Lord how you can grow in</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">obedience today.</p></li></ol><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lord Jesus, Light of the world, I praise You for walking with me through the darkness. Father God, please open the eyes of my heart that I may see Christ’s light illuminating my path and know how to live. I ask for grace to walk as a child of the light. Amen.</p>

      <title>O Little Town</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/12/5/iizkuaz3jufaa5rzqyg346zowqon3d</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture:</span></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days.”</em> (Micah 5:2) </p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading:</span></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On the night of Christ’s birth, nestled in the Judean hillside, heads rested on pillows aware of their insignificance amid grander neighbors. Angels rejoiced above, captivated by the Christ of Heaven now a helpless baby on earth. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Like any other morning, the townspeople awoke knowing Bethlehem was noted by God no matter the size of its tiny map dot. Little did they know, <em>“The Word became flesh and blood, and moved into the neighborhood.”</em> (John 1:14 MSG)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Lord became flesh not for us primarily, but for the Father. All that God revealed through the law, the prophets, and the psalms would be fulfilled by Jesus (Luke 24:27). Christ’s mission was to restore all people to God the Father. Of course, God’s plan was achieved perfectly.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Since the day of Christ’s resurrection and humanity’s restoration, God gives the Holy Spirit to those who place their trust in Christ. He is our assurance of salvation and guarantee of eternal life. <em>“…hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.”</em> (Romans 5:5)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As you remember Jesus’ miraculous birth in Bethlehem, remember He is near you. Christ is drawn to little places and no human heart is too remote for Him to reach. Like the ancients of Bethlehem rest in the assurance that God sees you and celebrate the gift of Jesus, the One who rules for God.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Application:</span></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meditate on the fact that God’s Spirit is within those who welcome Jesus as Savior and Lord. (John 14:26, 1 Corinthians 6:19)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glance through the gospels looking for the “little” in Jesus’ parables and circumstances. What is Jesus’ perspective of the insignificant, small, marginalized? What does this reveal about Jesus? About you?</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father God, thank You for the gift of Your Son Jesus. I am in awe when I rest and ponder that You have come to be with me. I trust You to rule in my life. I love You, Lord Jesus, and celebrate You! Amen.</p>

      <title>Completely Forgiven</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/2/16/completely-forgiven</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“I have told you all this so that you may have peace in me.  Here on earth, you will have many trials and sorrows.  But take heart, because I have overcome the world.”  John 16:33</em> </p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“...that you may have peace...” The word “may” in the original Greek language is <em>echo.</em> It implies that someone is “to have and to hold” a thing. Sound familiar? In a traditional marriage ceremony, each person echoes a vow to have and to hold one another as if they are one entity. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear believer in Jesus Christ, God has forgiven you. He has made peace with you through Christ so He can have you and hold you. As your Heavenly Father, He has vowed Himself to you throughout scripture. Christ will never leave those who entrust their lives to Him (John 14:16, Matthew 28:20). Because of Jesus, you are completely forgiven and now one with God. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The way God views you is fundamentally different than before you placed your trust in Christ, but only because for <em>“our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of God” (2 Cor 5:21).</em> </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Since you have been forgiven, saved, born again, redeemed, and justified, God, knows you as He intended – a reflection of His Son! </p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus...” (Ephesians 2:10) </em></p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Seeing through your Heavenly Father’s eyes, forgiven and free in Christ, changes how you experience life. His forgiveness gives you permission to forgive yourself and have peace. </p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Being one with Him empowers you to forgive others and brings healing to your soul. </h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As you see yourself through God’s eyes, completely forgiven, may peace echo the Lord Jesus’ vow to have you and hold you forever. He has indeed overcome your sin. Be encouraged, He has overcome even the world.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You for rescuing me. Thank You for Your perpetual forgiveness and for making me Your child. I believe You forgive me, so who am I to withhold mercy from myself and others? I humbly ask for the grace to see and forgive as You do. It is in Jesus Christ that I pray. Amen</p>

      <title>Get Your Hands on The Net</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/2/16/get-your-hands-on-the-net</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As Christians, we are called to spread the love and message of Jesus Christ. This can be done in many ways, and one of the most effective ways is by <strong><em>Getting Your Hands on The Net</em></strong>. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This phrase, taken from Matthew 4:19, means to be proactive in reaching out to others and sharing the hope and truth of the Gospel. One of the best ways to do this is by serving on a Dream Team at The Point Church.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In 1 Peter 4:10, we are told that we have each been given a spiritual gift, which is meant to be used to serve others. <strong><em>When we serve others, we are fulfilling our calling and purpose as Christians.</em></strong> We are also building relationships and making a positive impact on the world around us. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As Mother Teresa once said,</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples."</p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Serving on a dream team at The Point Church is a great way to <strong><em>Get Your Hands on The Net</em></strong> and serve others. The Dream Team is made up of people who have discovered their gifts and passions and are actively serving in them. Whether you have a gift for creating a comfortable environment for others, leading the next generation to Jesus, crafting a dynamic worship experience, or tearing down barriers in your community, there is a place for you on the Dream Team.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As famous Christian author and pastor, Rick Warren once said, </p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"You were created to make a difference in this world. God designed you to use your gifts, talents, and resources to fulfill a unique purpose." </p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">By serving on a Dream Team, you are fulfilling that purpose and making a positive impact on the world around you.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Another benefit of serving on a Dream Team is the opportunity for personal growth and spiritual development. When we step out of our comfort zones and serve others, we are challenged to rely on God and trust in His plan for our lives. As John C. Maxwell once said, </p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"Life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it." </p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Serving on a dream team can help us develop a positive and proactive attitude toward life, as we learn to trust in God's plan for us.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Finally, serving on a dream team can bring joy and fulfillment into our lives. As Jesus said in Acts 20:35, "It is more blessed to give than to receive." When we serve others, we are giving of ourselves and making a positive impact on the world around us. This brings joy and fulfillment into our lives, as we know that we are living out our purpose and making a difference in the world.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>Getting your hands on the net</em></strong> means being proactive in sharing the hope and truth of the Gospel with others.</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Serving on a Dream Team at The Point Church is a great way to do this, and it offers many benefits, including fulfilling our purpose as Christians, building relationships, personal growth, and bringing joy and fulfillment into our lives. As William Arthur Ward once said, "The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires." </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">By serving on a Dream Team, we can be great teachers, inspiring others to live out their purpose and make a positive impact on the world around them.</p>

      <title>Completely Forgiving</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/2/28/completely-forgiving</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How do you relieve a bruise after running into a corner? Aside from what words might escape your lips, typically the next thought is to apply ice to reduce swelling. Trauma produces inflammation and if you control inflammation, you control the degree of damage. Following that train of thought, how do you nurse a wounded, inflamed heart? The Lord Jesus tells us to apply forgiveness.<br><br>Forgiveness is often more than a "one and done" kind of decision. It is a willful choice, often repeated, to not pay back the pain someone has caused you. After that initial choice to forgive, trusting God to deal with your offender, how do you stop the residual&nbsp;anger and bitterness from engulfing your heart?<br><br>We find a solution in the parable of the unforgiving servant. </p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus said, <em>"Then the master of that servant had compassion, released him, and forgave him the loan." (Matthew 18:27)</em> </p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The man’s heart was moved with compassion before he released his debtor. <br><br>In scripture “compassion” is used to describe Jesus' heart before many of his miracles. Jesus experienced compassion before healing, teaching, feeding, and forgiving people, including those who were happy to torture him. In each instance, Jesus experienced compassion before releasing God’s mercy. <br><br><strong>By placing your faith in Christ, you too are a recipient of his miraculous compassion and mercy!</strong> <br><br>So you have something in common with the one who has sinned against you: the propensity to sin and the need for forgiveness. Relating in this way is not only humbling, but it empowers you to apply Christ's compassion to your perpetrator and quench the fire of unforgiveness.&nbsp;From this awareness you “forgive your brother from your heart.” (Luke 18:35) This does not imply restoration or trust. Prayerfully seek the Lord’s will in moving forward.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Guidance to Forgiving from Your Heart:</span></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. <em>"Set your mind on things that are above, not on things that are on earth." (Colossians 3:2)</em> First, recognize the miracle of Christ's compassion specifically to you through His saving power.&nbsp;<br><br>2. <em>"Therefore, put to death...&nbsp;put away&nbsp;all the following: anger,&nbsp;wrath,&nbsp;malice,&nbsp;slander,&nbsp;and filthy <br>language from your mouth." (Col. 3:5, 8)</em> Repent and ask God to transform you. Depend on Him <br>to lead you in His ways.<br><br>3. <em>"Therefore, as God’s chosen ones, holy and dearly loved,&nbsp;put on compassion, <br>kindness,&nbsp;humility,&nbsp;gentleness,&nbsp;and patience,&nbsp;bearing with one another and forgiving one <br>another if anyone has a grievance against another. Just as the Lord has forgiven you, so you are also to forgive." (Col. 3:12-13) As a follower of Christ choose to live out your new identity – his character and compassion. Pu</em>tting to death old ways of dealing with pain is not easy, but scripture says you are a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17).&nbsp;If you are willing, there is grace to completely forgive like Jesus. You have the power to release others to God and your wounded heart from the inflammation of sin. </p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You for forgiving me. You are so merciful and compassionate! I put away (anger, malice, bitterness...) and put on Christ’s nature. I choose to forgive this person and release them to You. Thank You for Your grace. It is in Jesus’ name I pray, amen.</p>

  <blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save<br>him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.” (James 2:14-17)</p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br>Daily I see a neighbor helping others: bringing a meal to an elderly shut-in, assisting a single mom with her responsibilities, lending a hand with yard work, and in general, being an exceptional neighbor. He is a beautiful influence and he is not a Christian.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br>A person does not need the Holy Spirit to make a difference. <strong>However, the Holy Spirit empowers a believer to help in the name of Christ, producing His fruit,</strong> <strong>and pointing people to the Lord rather than<br>themselves.</strong> </p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works<br>and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.” (Matthew 5:16)</p></blockquote><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> Our faith is meant to make a physical difference; it’s meant to do some good.</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br>The help you give in Jesus’ name is “evidence of things unseen.” (Hebrews 11:1). God, who has revealed Himself through scripture and in the person of Jesus Christ, also reveals His existence through you when you meet others’ needs. In fulfilling a tangible need, a door often opens to minister the compassion and hope of Jesus Christ. The gospel becomes known and meaningful to others through your help.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br>First John 4 shares that if you “have come to know and to believe the love that God has for [you],” you will love others as you love yourself (Matthew 22:39). When the Son of God walked the earth as a neighbor, he “went around doing good.” (Acts 10:38) In fact, as a believer you have been born again “created in Christ for good works, which God prepared ahead of time for [you] to do.” (Ephesians 2:10)</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br>You have been entrusted with God’s love, example, and assignment!</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br>Beyond helping your neighbor, there are numerous ways for you to minister Christ’s compassion at The Point. Our REACH small groups serve local underprivileged and underserved neighborhoods that include refugees. Mission trips are open to join and opportunities to financially support our REACH partners in 13 countries.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br>Just imagine how God will bless people as you ask Him to highlight your opportunities to love and do good. Look for ways to help. Remember, putting action to those thoughts offers evidence of His love. <strong>Your community will be touched by God as you love your neighbors just like Jesus.</strong><br></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer:</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You for the gift of salvation in Jesus Christ and Your Holy Spirit. Please fill me with compassion and make me a vessel of Your love. Shine Your light on the good works you want me to do for Your glory. I want to give others the hope and joy of loving Jesus. Amen.</p>

And let us run with endurance the race God has set before us." </em>(Hebrews 12:1 NLT)&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God has set you in your lane with everything needed for a dynamic life with Him. If you are not careful though, you may jump lanes from "love your neighbor" to "watch your neighbor" without a second thought.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This habit is a hard one to break because it is human nature to compare to find significance. When we measure ourselves against people, sadly we apply a value system God did not create. As a result, we tend to fall into the pits of self-criticism or self-exaltation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In contrast, imagining who you can become because of Jesus Christ is a healthy comparison.</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> "<em>The LORD will work out his plans for my life— for your faithful love, O LORD, endures forever." </em>(Psalm 138:8) </p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This type of comparison shifts your perspective to better see that God is your Source of every blessing and success, not yourself.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When you are tempted to compare yourself to another person, instead of feeling envious or self-loathsome, combat those lies with the opposite spirit. Give sincere congratulations, and heart that darn picture on social media. Look for God's goodness and ask Him to reorient you to your lane.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Your significance lies in being one infinitely valued by your Heavenly Father. He is at work in your life. </h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dallas Willard wrote,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The obviously well-kept secret of the ‘ordinary’ is that it is made to be a receptacle of the divine, a place where the life of God flows.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Remember God does not look to your left or right. You have a tremendous crowd cheering you on (Heb. 12:1). Find your lane and run your race.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer:</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, please help me not to compare myself to others. You are my Source. Lord Jesus, grace me to run my race and keep my eyes on You. Amen.</p>

      <title>What Will Jesus Find?</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/3/17/what-what-jesus-find</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>"May no one ever eat fruit from you again."</em> (Mark 11:14) Jesus said this to a lone fig tree near the road he and his disciples&nbsp;were travelling. Imagining myself in the scene, I fear I would have been that impulsive disciple piping up with, "Lord, that’s pretty harsh!” Was Jesus truly angry that a tree did not produce fruit out of season?<br><br>Although Jesus was fully human, He was also fully God. God who is slow to anger. We can be certain that any frustration&nbsp;with this verse is due to our limited knowledge, not the nature of Jesus Christ.<br><br>The details in Mark 11:12-14 lead us to better understand what Jesus was saying. Scripture says it was <em>"a fig tree in leaf"</em> and <em>"that he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs."</em>&nbsp;(vv. 12-13)&nbsp;<br><br>As leaves start to unfurl on fig trees, little knobs also form. They drop from the tree prior to the figs’ fruition. These were a favorite source of food for travelers of Jesus' time. You can picture a single fig tree on the horizon full of bright green leaves and the promise of a delicious snack. <br><br>The fact that there were no knobs on this beckoning tree shows it was unhealthy and perhaps dying regardless of how it looked on the outside. Jesus was simply declaring the obvious.&nbsp;He was using this fig tree as an illustration to confront his disciples - and still does.<br>Keep in mind this occurs just before Jesus enters the temple to clear it. Standing in the Court of the Gentiles, where people from all nations worshiped God, Jesus finds hundreds of people making business transactions and busy with religiosity.&nbsp;<br><br>Jesus drove out these hypocrites flipping over their tables and chairs. He even stopped them from taking irreverent shortcuts through the temple. He then boldly taught from the prophet Isaiah who said,&nbsp;<em>“And&nbsp;the foreigners who join themselves to the&nbsp;Lord,&nbsp;to minister to him, to love the name of the&nbsp;Lord,&nbsp;and to be his servants,&nbsp;everyone&nbsp;who keeps the Sabbath and does not profane it,&nbsp;and holds fast my covenant —&nbsp;these I will bring to&nbsp;my holy mountain,&nbsp;and make them joyful in my house of prayer;&nbsp;their burnt offerings and their sacrifices&nbsp;will be accepted on my altar;&nbsp; for &nbsp; my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples .”</em> (Isaiah 65:6-7)<br><br>Like the fig tree, Jesus found no spiritual fruit in the temple. It was full of religious people taking their work and busyness very seriously; however, people intimate with God were not found. The people of God looked as though they were in full bloom, but they were not fulfilling their purpose.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>It is a tremendous thought that if you trust Jesus Christ as Savior, you are now "a temple of the Holy Spirit." (1 Corinthians 6:19) He lives in you. </em></p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Having been grafted to Christ, He has made a way to bear much fruit through you. You can now be a healthy branch abiding in God. <em>"This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples." </em>(John 15:8)<br><br>Realize that God longs for you to share the fruit of being in relationship with Him. Jesus Christ <br>strategically chose you to reveal Him at this time! (John 15:16) The Holy Spirit equips and empowers you to yield fruit that will feed your generation. What will Jesus find when he looks at your life?</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer</h3>

<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Heavenly Father, thank You for drawing me near through Your Son Jesus Christ. I want to be closer to <br>You, Lord. Please bear Your fruit and be revealed through my life. Amen.</em></p>

      <title>Lonely</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/3/2/lonely</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Imagine a child without a sin nature or selfish motivation. Before you claim to know that perfect tyke, consider what an oddball that likely would make him or her. I mean, peers and siblings might have a hard time relating to the kid. Now, imagine a teen equally pure hearted and acutely sensitive to sin and evil. Likely, feeling misunderstood, disconnected, and lonely would be a regular experience. As an exceptionally unique person, it makes sense to me that Jesus may have been well acquainted with loneliness even as a child.</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Scripture testifies that as an adult Jesus experienced times of incredible loneliness. <em>“He was hated and rejected; his life was filled with sorrow and terrible suffering.”</em> (Isaiah 53:3 CEV) </p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For instance, Jesus spent 40 days isolated in the desert battling Satan’s temptations. Constantly throughout his ministry he was misunderstood and rejected. He was lonely and disappointed with the company of close friends in Gethsemane. And of course, his solitary experience at Calvary as well as being forsaken by his Father were devasting moments of extreme loneliness in Jesus’ life. (Matthew 27:46)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Because Jesus Christ was <em>“born in the likeness of men”</em> and is God, he can both empathize and guide you out of loneliness. (Philippians 2:7) </p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.”</em> (Hebrews 4:15) </p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Charles Spurgeon made this beautiful point, "Christ leads me through no darker rooms than he went through&nbsp;before."</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is not God's desire for you to feel lonely. Withdrawing, isolating, and loneliness are symptoms of disunity, which is not God's will for a member of the body of Christ (see Romans 12:4, Ephesians 2:19). </p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He has formed you to be in relationship with Himself and connected to others. </h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Because of Jesus Christ’s redemption, all forms of suffering, including loneliness, are passing away for those who trust in him. Confidently <em>“draw near to the throne of grace, that [you] may receive mercy and find grace to help”</em> when you feel lonely. (Hebrews 4:16) Pray that God will reveal your next step in strengthening relationships. God has people for you and people who need you!</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>"The friendship of the LORD is for those who fear him, and he makes known to them his covenant."</em> (Psalm 25:14) </p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Your Savior understands and has promised his companionship. His Presence is right there with you and His Spirit indwells you. May Lord Jesus continue to reveal his friendship to you as you befriend him.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer:</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, please turn to me and be gracious when I am lonely and afflicted. Lord, I believe You are near to me and save the crushed in spirit. I ask for guidance out of loneliness. Please reveal Your Presence to me. It is in Christ Jesus’ name that I pray. Amen.</p>

      <title>Wake Up Call</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/3/30/wake-up-call</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Can you imagine what a shocking wakeup call Christ's return&nbsp;will&nbsp;be?&nbsp;<br><br>One unknown day <em>"the Lord himself will descend&nbsp;from heaven&nbsp;with a cry of command, with the voice of&nbsp;an archangel, and&nbsp;with the sound of the trumpet of God."</em>&nbsp;(1 Thessalonians 4:16a) How incredible for those who have put their&nbsp;trust in Christ Jesus and will <em>"always be with the Lord."</em> (v17)<br><br>Jesus tells us,&nbsp;<em>"Be on guard,&nbsp;keep awake.&nbsp;For you do not know when the time will come."&nbsp;(Mark <br>13:33)</em> God desires for every generation to be wide awake to Christ’s imminent return. In these <br>passages, Jesus is waking us up. </p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>"It is like a man&nbsp;going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his servants&nbsp;in charge,&nbsp;each with his work, and commands&nbsp;the doorkeeper to stay awake."&nbsp;(Mark 13:34)</em> </p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Jesus tells us to be on guard, awake and ready for his return while fulfilling our God-given responsibilities.</strong> Christian, you have been chosen to work with God to rescue and bless souls.<br><br>Occasionally, I wonder if I am doing enough to serve God - until I remember Jesus. Mary said <br>this wonderful thing to the servants at the wedding in Cana: <em>"Do whatever he tells you."</em> (John <br>2:5) That's it. <br><br>Are you doing whatever Jesus has told you? That inkling to serve, the unction to help, the <br>direction that aligns with scripture, those may be promptings from the Holy Spirit; a sign that <br>you are spiritually sensitive and obedient. When you get your hands on the net, whether that <br>looks like inviting someone to church or preaching a sermon, you serve Jesus by serving others <br>(Philippians 2:5-11). </p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Here are suggestions to awaken you to His light if you are feeling spiritually groggy:</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. <strong>Confess Sin.</strong> Come into agreement that Christ is the Lord leading your life and you are not. <br>Receive His forgiveness and ask the Holy Spirit to point out serving opportunities prepared for <br>you.&nbsp;<em>"So if anyone purifies himself from anything dishonorable,&nbsp;he will be a special instrument, <br>set apart, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work."</em>&nbsp;(2 Timothy 2:21)<br><br>2. <strong>Pray &amp; Read God's Word.</strong> In doing so, your eyes will be opened to how Jesus lived.&nbsp;You will <br>see the correlation between Scripture and everyday experiences. The more time you&nbsp;spend with your friend Jesus, the more you will become like him.&nbsp;<em>"Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path."</em>&nbsp;(Psalm 119:105)<br><br>3. <strong>Do Something.</strong> Whether it is doing the next right thing or agreeing to serve in a capacity <br>beyond your current comfort level, this is where God's grace is on display in your life.&nbsp;<em>“My <br>grace is sufficient for you, for&nbsp;my power is made perfect in weakness.”</em>&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 12:9) <br>The beauty of a wakeup call is knowing something rewarding awaits you. <em>"Whatever you do, <br>work heartily,&nbsp;as for the Lord and not for men,&nbsp;knowing that from the Lord&nbsp;you will receive the <br>inheritance as your reward.&nbsp;You are serving the Lord Christ."</em>&nbsp;(Colossians 3:23-24) One unknown day you will see Jesus Christ face to face, but while you are here do whatever he tells <br>you.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">PRAYER</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You for the promise of eternity with You. Please help me to faithfully <br>complete the work You have prepared for me. Awaken me to Your will. In the powerful name of<br>Jesus Christ, I pray. Amen.</p>

      <title>Why You Should Get Involved in REACH Serve Day</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/3/30/why-you-should-get-involved-in-reach-serve-day</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Why You Should Get Involved in REACH Serve Day</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As believers, we are called to love and serve others, just as Jesus did during his time on earth. REACH Serve Day is an opportunity for us to put this calling into action by serving our local community and sharing the love of God in practical ways. Here are a few reasons why you should get involved in REACH Serve Day:</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We are called to love our neighbors.</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In Mark 12:31, Jesus commands us to "love your neighbor as yourself." This means that we are called to show love and kindness to those around us, regardless of their background or circumstances. REACH Serve Day provides a tangible way to love our neighbors by meeting practical needs and building relationships with those we serve.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Serving others is a way to show our faith.</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">James 2:14-17 reminds us that faith without action is dead. When we serve others, we are demonstrating our faith in a tangible way, showing others the love of Christ through our actions. REACH Serve Day is an opportunity to put our faith into action and make a difference in the lives of those around us.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We are called to be the hands and feet of Jesus.</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In John 13:15, Jesus tells his disciples, "I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you." Jesus spent his time on earth serving others, healing the sick, and sharing the good news of salvation. As his followers, we are called to do the same. REACH Serve Day is a chance to be the hands and feet of Jesus by serving our community and sharing his love with those around us.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Serving others brings joy.</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Proverbs 11:25 tells us that "a generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed." When we serve others, we not only bring joy to those we serve but also experience joy ourselves. There is something incredibly fulfilling about making a positive impact in the lives of those around us. REACH Serve Day is an opportunity to experience this joy firsthand.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus’s first disciples were fishermen casting a net. In Matthew 4:19, “Jesus called out to them, “Come, follow me, and I will show you how to fish for people!” Jesus calls YOU to do the same. </p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Get Your Hands on The Net and join us for our REACH Serve Day!&nbsp;</h2>

  <h3 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Baby Dedications</strong></h3>
</div>

<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dedicating a child to growing up in a community of Christian believers is an important milestone for parents who want to raise their children with a strong foundation of faith. </p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Child dedication is a public declaration of a parent's commitment to raising their child in the love and knowledge of Jesus Christ, with the support and guidance of a community of believers.</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the Bible, we see many examples of parents bringing their children to Jesus for blessing and prayer, such as when Jesus said,</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these" (Matthew 19:14).</p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Similarly, child dedication is a way for parents to present their child before God and ask for His blessing and guidance as they navigate the joys and challenges of parenting.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In addition to seeking God's blessing, child dedication also serves as an opportunity for parents to publicly commit to raising their child in a community of believers. This is important because we are not meant to walk through life alone. The journey of faith is best navigated in the company of others who share our values and beliefs. When parents dedicate their children to growing in a community of Christian believers, they are committing to actively seek out and participate in a community of faith where their children can learn, grow, and thrive.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Furthermore, dedicating a child to growing up in a community of Christian believers can have a profound impact on the child's spiritual development. </h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When a child grows up surrounded by people who love and follow Jesus, they are more likely to develop a strong faith of their own. They have the opportunity to see firsthand how faith impacts the lives of those around them and to learn from the wisdom and experiences of others.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Child dedication is a powerful way for parents to publicly declare their commitment to raising their child in the love and knowledge of Jesus Christ.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is a beautiful reminder that parenting is a partnership between parents and God and that we are all called to support and encourage one another on our faith journey.</h2>

In Hebrews 10:24-25, we're instructed to "consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another." Being a part of a community like The Point Church helps us grow in our faith and encourages us to continue pursuing righteousness.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Discipleship:</strong> In Matthew 28:19-20, Jesus commands us to "go and make disciples of all nations... teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you." Being a part of a church community provides us with opportunities to be discipled and to disciple others. It's a crucial part of our spiritual growth.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Accountability:</strong> In Proverbs 27:17, we're told that "as iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another." Being a part of a community like The Point Church helps us stay accountable to one another. We can encourage each other to stay on the right path and avoid temptation.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Service:</strong> In Galatians 5:13, we're told to "serve one another in love." Being a part of a church community gives us opportunities to serve others and use our gifts to build up the body of Christ. It helps us grow in humility and love.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Encouragement:</strong> In 1 Thessalonians 5:11, we're instructed to "encourage one another and build each other up." Being a part of a community like The Point Church helps us find encouragement and support when we're going through difficult times. We can lift each other up and provide hope and strength when it's needed most.</p></li></ol><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> So if you're looking to grow in your faith and deepen your connection to others, we encourage you to attend CONNECT and get connected to The Point Church community today.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So don't hesitate - sign up for CONNECT today! It's the perfect opportunity to connect with others, deepen your faith, and find your place in The Point's community. We look forward to seeing you there!</p>

      <title>A Living Savior</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/4/12/a-living-savior</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The second earthquake in three days shook the Judean landscape and&nbsp;<em>"an angel of the Lord came down from heaven, rolled aside the stone, and sat on it." (Matthew 28:2)</em> So much for a stone, a seal, and soldiers controlling the Son of God. Jesus was not there! The angel rolled the stone away to invite the terrified women into the tomb to see for themselves.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"He isn’t here! He is risen from the dead, just as he said would happen. Come, see where his body was lying.&nbsp;And now, go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and he is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there. Remember what I have told you.” (Matt. 28:6-7) </p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus lives. Through scripture we are invited to observe the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. We are drawn to see for ourselves that Jesus fulfilled scripture as the Messiah and inspect the evidence that he lives.<br><br>The eyewitness testimony itself is stunning. Jesus first appeared to the women, then Peter, next to his disciples over a period of 40 days, and to more than 500 people at one time (1 Corinthians 15:5-6; Acts 1:3). Scripture says, <em>"but these are written so that you may&nbsp;believe that Jesus is the Christ,&nbsp;the Son of God, and that by believing&nbsp;you may have life&nbsp;in his name." (John 20:31)</em> <br><br>We have been invited ‘in’ to see for ourselves.</p>
</div>

<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." (John 3:16)&nbsp;<br><br>"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23)<br><br>"But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God..." (John 1:12)</p></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is no stone that can keep God's love from you. There is no authority that can keep His grace from you. There is no presence that can keep His Spirit from filling you. <em>"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation;&nbsp;the old has passed away, and see,&nbsp;the new has&nbsp;come!" (2 Corinthians 5:17)</em> As you believe in your living Savior, may every dead thing in you pass away, and may the Lord resurrect your life in him.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer:</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank you for the resurrection of Jesus! Thank you for my salvation through faith in Him. I pray for your resurrection power to remove anything that holds me back from experiencing newness of life in my Savior Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>

      <title>Impossible Situations</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/4/27/impossible-situations</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The fury of an impossible situation can feel like a death sentence. The truth is- your problem is not greater than Jesus Christ. Your challenges do not surprise the sovereign God&nbsp;who says,&nbsp;<em>"Call on me in the day of trouble; I will rescue you, and you will honor me.” </em>(Psalm 50:15) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God’s rescue is exactly what a captive teenager experienced under the irrational demand of a violent king.&nbsp;Only God <em>"whose dwelling is not with mortals" </em>(Daniel 2:11) could know what the king dreamed and what it implied. However, Daniel knew the living God. His perspective was not on the threat of death, but the sovereignty of God.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"The king replied to the Chaldeans, <em>“My word is final: If you don’t tell me the dream and its interpretation, you will be torn limb from limb, and your houses will be made a garbage dump." </em>(Dan. 2:5)&nbsp; Without God’s intervention, Daniel was doomed as an associate of the&nbsp;king’s prestigious men. However, along with Kingdom perspective Daniel had allies. He <em>"urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon." </em>(Dan. 2:18)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer is not only important, it is essential. Daniel knew he was powerless to save himself. He fervently asked God for mercy, not only for his own life, but for the lives of his friends and community. The stakes were high, so Daniel bowed low knowing God gives wisdom, knowledge, and understanding. Then incredibly, Daniel rested. <em>"During the night, the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven..." </em>(Dan. 2:19)&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I imagine Daniel's praise spilled everywhere he went that day (see Dan. 2:19-23). With enthusiasm, he explained honestly to the king that <em>"there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries." </em>(Dan. 2:28a) Daniel&nbsp;celebrated the greatness of God and the&nbsp;only Kingdom that will endure forever.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God honored Daniel for his faithfulness. The same is true for you as you seek God's will and obey Him. Not even an impossible situation can thwart God’s plan and purpose for your life. Continue to call on your Heavenly Father and praise Him for how He will reveal His greatness.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer:</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lord God, You are greater than my problems and have perfect understanding. I ask for Your wisdom and help. May you receive all praise and glory. Thank You, Lord Jesus. Amen.</p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What an incredible example we have in Daniel who understood that exercising faith in God eradicates fear, gives power, and a sound mind (see 2 Timothy 1:7). For a second time, King Nebuchadnezzar summoned Daniel to interpret another disturbing dream. The arrogant king needed a faithful person to speak truth to him.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">King Nebuchadnezzar was flourishing at the epitome of his reign believing&nbsp;he was the source of his success. In His mercy, God warned the king through a nightmare of impending judgement. </p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"This is so that the living will know&nbsp;that the Most High is ruler&nbsp;over human kingdoms.&nbsp;He gives them to anyone he wants&nbsp;and sets the lowliest of people over them." (Dan. 4:17)</p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Daniel likely felt concern as well as conviction to share the truth with this incredibly prideful man. <em>"Everyone with a proud heart is detestable to the&nbsp;Lord;&nbsp;be assured, he will not go unpunished."</em>  (Proverbs 16:5) As disciples of Christ we too are to <em>"speak the truth in love."</em> (Ephesians 4:15) Like Daniel, our compassion and conviction are meant to work together.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sadly, pride is the great sin that infects not only kings, but you and me. We are quick to despise pride in others, yet it is much harder to pinpoint in our own hearts. When we consider ourselves to be the plumb line of what is admirable and give credit to ourselves, we push truth aside and agree with the lie that made Satan God’s enemy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Commentator Bryan Chapell wrote, <em>"Talent, brains, and opportunity mean nothing apart from God's provision."</em>  We are wise to remember what God supplies and even allows us to become is a gift of pure grace.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">By this grace, the king acknowledged God and stopped quite literally living like a donkey (Dan. 4:32-33). <em>"But at the end of those days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to heaven, and my sanity returned to me. Then I praised the Most High and honored and glorified him who lives forever..." (Dan. 4:34)</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>"Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, exalt, and glorify the King of the heavens, because all his works are true and his ways are just.&nbsp;He is able to humble&nbsp;those who walk in pride." (Dan. 4:37)</em> </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The moment the disturbed king worshipped the Most High, God restored him to being a man created in His image. Nebuchadnezzar proclaimed the universal, timeless truths that (1) <em>"all his works are true,"</em> (2) <em>"his ways are just,"</em> and (3)&nbsp;<em>"He is able to humble&nbsp;those who walk in pride." (Dan. 4:37)</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever."</em> (Hebrews 13:8) King Nebuchadnezzar is the antithesis of Christ our King. Jesus is sinless, eternal God, merciful servant, humble and exalted by God (see Philippians 2:6-11). This is the faith we fan into flame. The gift which gives a sound mind to worship God and serve His Kingdom. Today lift your eyes to the Most High King who loves you, restores you, and empowers you to be a truth teller for His glory.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, please help me recognize and overcome pride. You are the giver of all good gifts, my Source of strength and comfort. I look to You in humility for help. I pray this in my mighty Savior Jesus' name.</p>

      <title>Integrity</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/5/24/integrity</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My father worked for the U.S. Office of Special Counsel. He once investigated a case involving a government employee who blew the whistle on the U.S. Secretary of State. I remember thinking how courageous the person must have been to stand in their integrity knowing it would cost them their career. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Daniel was similar. His outward life mirrored his inward convictions. By the time we read Daniel 6, Daniel was over eighty years old and had a well-established lifestyle of praying three times a day (Daniel 6:10). </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Whatever Daniel prayed during this time, I am convinced his prayer life was driven by devotion to God, not answers from God. By choosing to please God, Daniel’s devotion built integrity, which in turn created habits that opened a window to his Heavenly Father. </p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Then the other administrators and high officers began searching for some fault in the way Daniel was handling government affairs, but they couldn’t find anything to criticize or condemn. He was faithful, always responsible, and completely trustworthy.” (Dan. 6:4) </p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When jealousy roared in the hearts of Daniel’s coworkers, they pandered to the ego of a powerful man. They knew the only way Daniel would fail the king would be to attack his relationship with God. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Where does Satan know you might fail the Almighty King? What is the one desire you cannot shake? The wrong your mind replays demanding justice? What need do you strive to fulfill rather than asking God? This is your lions’ den. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What you do matters. It matters because of God’s purpose for your life. Daniel honored God. He was not sinless, but when challenged he chose God. Because of the gift of the Holy Spirit, you too can stand in your integrity when facing threat and say, “I honored God and didn’t do any wrong.” (see Titus 2:11-14) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.” </em>(1 Peter 5:8) But <em>“Look closely, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome and conquered!” </em>(Revelation 5:5) Just as Daniel was sealed in the lions’ den, Christ was sealed in the tomb. In both cases, these dens of death brought God greater glory. Daniel was delivered from death and Jesus Christ overcame it once for all. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The God that <em>“...delivers and rescues; he works signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, he who has saved Daniel from the power of the lions”</em> is your God too, my friend. (Dan. 6:27) Determine today to courageously honor Him even if it might cost you.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You that You rule in my life. You are my refuge and strength, an ever-present help in times of trouble. I commit myself to pleasing You. Help me keep my integrity regardless of the circumstances. In Jesus’ mighty name, I pray. Amen.</p>

      <title>Thoughts</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I feared meeting a grizzly the entire&nbsp;hike. The plan was to pull over and admire the waterfall, but my family was not content to simply sightsee. They wanted adventure which meant following a well-worn path to who knows where.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As the tall pines thinned, we found ourselves&nbsp;in a breathtaking canyon. Ancient lava flows&nbsp;towered above while a peaceful river sliced through a pebbled beach. Our kids ran ahead, stuffing their pockets with handfuls of stunning rocks. My young geologists had found treasure and were loading up!&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Scripture says that the Word of God is <em>"more desirable than gold — than an abundance of pure gold; and sweeter than honey dripping from a honeycomb."</em> (Psalm 19:10) It renews your mind, empowering you to discern the will of God (Romans 12:2). It is a lamp and a light for your life’s journey (Ps. 119:105). </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Your Bible is spiritual treasure revealing eternal truth about all of creation and the dynamics ruling our world. Rushing rivers dry up and ancient mountains crumble, but Jesus promised, <em>"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away."</em> (Matthew&nbsp;24:35) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">By letting <em>“the word of Christ dwell in you richly”</em> (Colossians 3:16), you will know eternal truth. You will recognize it, you will think it, you will speak it. Paul wrote, <em>"Finally brothers and sisters, whatever is true...—dwell on these things."</em> (Philippians 4:8) Jesus said,&nbsp;<em>“If you continue in my word,&nbsp;you really are my disciples.&nbsp;You will know the truth,&nbsp;and the truth will set you free.”</em> (John 8:31-32)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Your Heavenly Father desires for you to fill more than your pockets with lovely bits of this world. He wants you to saturate your mind with what is true. You are created in His image with the ability to have thoughts reflective of His nature. In fact, He directs you to think about whatever is true, honorable, just, pure, lovely, and commendable (Phil. 4:8).&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus Christ also revealed that the greatest commandment is to <em>"Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind."</em> (Matthew 22:37) All your mind. You are loving God when you fill your thoughts with what is true and reliable - God's Word. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God is your Rock, and His Words are true (Ps. 119:160). His thoughts toward you <em>"outnumber the grains of sand." (Ps. 139:18)</em> Respond in kind like an excited kid, rushing to fill your thoughts with the treasure of His Word. How much better than handfuls of rocks!</p><h3 style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer:</h3><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">Thank You, Heavenly Father, that Your Word is available to me. Please give me a willingness and supernatural ability to fill my mind with Your truth. Help me to treasure it. Jesus Christ is the Word made flesh and it is in His name that I pray. Amen</p>

      <title>What Is True</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/6/6/what-is-true</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"I don't want to, Mom. I can't!"&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I stood with my young daughter under a towering oak, in part for shade and in part to hide. With tears in her eyes, she pleaded&nbsp;to sit out of her soccer scrimmage. Her new teammates were older, more experienced, and worst of all had welcomed her with condescending stares. Intimidation and self-doubt were having a field day. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After much&nbsp;affirmation&nbsp;and&nbsp;encouragement, positive words did not move her forward. A change of belief was needed, so we took a little walk. During that time, the Holy Spirit called to mind&nbsp;scripture we had memorized together. While I affirmed that her feelings were real, I reminded her of what is true.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The truth is:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>"...the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world."</em> (1 John 4:4) You are God's kid and an overcomer. <em>"So do not fear, for [God is] with you; do not be dismayed, for [He is] your God. [He] will strengthen you and help you..." </em>(Isaiah 41:10) Do you remember how God's <em>"perfect love casts out fear?"</em>&nbsp;(1 John 4:18) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Scripture says, <em>"His power is made perfect in [your] weakness"</em> (2 Corinthians 12:9) and you <em>"can do all things through Christ who strengthens [you]."</em> (Philippians 4:13)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To my amazement, my girl said she knew what to do and walked right back into the game. She ended up playing an integral role and leaving the soccer field with a transformed perspective of herself and her teammates.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Holy Spirit reminded me of truth we have memorized and used it to reorient my daughter’s thinking. Storing up God's Word (Psalm 119:11) gave the Holy Spirit words to call to my mind that empowered her.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>"The unfolding of your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple."</em> (Psalm 119:30) His Word is alive and active (Hebrews 4:12) and does not return void (Isaiah 55:11). There is power in memorizing scripture.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">By cherishing His Word, God guides you into a way of life that is genuinely good and beautiful. You can do this! Recall what is true and enjoy the light that shines on your path as you memorize scripture.</p><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><span style="text-decoration:underline">Simple tips for memorizing&nbsp;scripture:</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">1. Pray for the desire and grace to memorize scripture.</p><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">2.&nbsp;Take your verse personally. Storing up God’s Word is about interacting with Him, not a religious should.</p><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">3. Tell someone. Accountability or memorizing with a friend is a huge help!&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">4. Start with a short verse. Choose a translation that strikes you. (<a href="http://www.biblehub.com/"><span style="text-decoration:underline">www.BibleHub.com</span></a>)</p><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">5. Write the verse and carry it with you. Post it places where you will notice it throughout your day.</p><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">6. Repeat, repeat, repeat in writing and aloud. Try writing your verse, then tracing it multiple times in assorted colors. Your verse may even be put to music on YouTube. There are countless ways to rehearse your verse!</p><h3 style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h3><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">Father God, please give me life according to Your Word! Help me to fill my mind and heart with scripture. They are my delight and my counselors. In Jesus Christ’s name, I pray. Amen.</p>

      <title>Tell Me Something</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/7/19/tell-me-something</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A crop of shocking white hair against Gardenia’s island skin perfectly embodied her name. As a handful of us entered her dilapidated home, she was praising God. In our hands we carried raw chicken, flour, and oil; a fortune for our Cuban friend who had just opened her last can of beans. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Gardenia practically glowed radiant with joy. She referred to herself as a missionary who shared the gospel with her people for decades despite oppression. This woman was the real deal, and I was enamored.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Tell me something about God,” she urged with a reverently bowed head. Tongue tied and stunned, I opened my Bible and randomly read a verse lit up by yellow highlighter. It was not my finest moment of ministry because whatever I read, it did not fit the situation in the slightest.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Peter, one of Jesus’ closest disciples, said to a lame beggar, <em>“I don’t have any silver or gold for you. But I’ll give you what I have. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, get up and walk!”</em> (Acts 3:6) Peter and John <em>“looked at him intently”</em> (v4) and leaned in to help in the name of Jesus.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Throughout the gospels and Acts tremendous miracles occur <em>“in the name of Jesus.”</em> Disease, demons, and death are eradicated in the name of Jesus. The name of Jesus transforms lives and alters eternal destinies.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the name of Jesus sometimes we see miraculous healings. Sometimes we experience strength in our weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9), or wisdom in our ignorance (James 1:5). Sometimes, like Gardenia, we experience provision coming through the door when we least expect it (Matthew 7:11). </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You have been positioned in this time and place (Acts 17:26) to <em>“proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.”</em> (1 Peter 2:9) Just as Peter and John modeled Jesus, who was <em>“mighty in deed and word”</em> (Luke 24:19), we can too.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Do you believe in the power of the name of Jesus? Is there something you could tell others about God in the name of Jesus?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It makes me smile thinking about beautiful Gardenia shouting praise to God and dancing as we left her home. I had a small part in bringing her chicken and an awkward scripture reading, and she gave me marching orders.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Gardenia’s words, “Tell me something about God,” are at the forefront of my mind when I get to write, speak, teach, disciple - love. Remember with me that the name of Jesus has power to strengthen, sustain, and save people from their sins. There is hope in the name of Jesus. Let’s be like Jesus and tell them something about God.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, in the name of Jesus thank You for choosing me, making me holy, and setting me apart as your own treasure. I ask for the grace to reveal You to those around me in deed and word like my Savior. I pray to glorify You. Amen.</p>

      <title>Rest</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"You're weary," my friend said to me. I remember because 'weary' perfectly echoed my agitated state. I was exhausted and my mind felt harassed by discouragement. Have you too experienced burdens obstructing your way forward?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus was referring to bondage when He said, "<em>Come to Me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.&nbsp;All of you, take up My yoke and learn from Me, because I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for yourselves. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light."  </em>(Matthew 11:28-30)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus promised more than temporary relief. He promised cessation. He promised rest.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we turn from our burdens to Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit reconciles us to the peace of God. There is freedom from what frustrates and perplexes us, because we&nbsp;submit to His lordship, His perfect understanding&nbsp;and care.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>"Casting the whole of your care [all your anxieties, all your worries, all your concerns, once and for all] on Him, for He cares for you affectionately and cares about you watchfully."</em> (1 Peter 5:7) Jesus paints a picture of this spiritual truth through his illustration of taking up His yoke.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In Jesus’ time, a young, smaller ox is yoked to a mature ox to learn to walk as a team. The larger ox inevitably carries most of the weight of the yoke upon his shoulders. By&nbsp;submitting to&nbsp;the Lord's guidance, He carries the weight of your load and gently teaches you His way.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The New Testament writers tell us to <em>"learn Christ"</em> (Ephesians 4:20), <em>"have the same mindset as Christ"</em> (Philippians 2:5), and <em>"live as Jesus did"</em> (1 John 2:6). Jesus said, <em>"I have given you an example to follow. Do as I have done to you."</em> (John 13:15)&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Being yoked to Jesus Christ you are present with Him while he pulls your load with you. The great exchange of bondage for partnership also empowers you to walk alongside Him in the Spirit drawing in the Kingdom of heaven and reconciling souls to God (2 Corinthians 5:18).&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Experience rest for your soul in coming to the One <em>"who knows all things"</em> (1 John 3:20) and <em>"holds all things together"</em> (Colossians 1:17). He promises to <em>"refresh the weary soul and replenish all who are weak."</em>&nbsp;(Jeremiah 31:25)</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Today:</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Respond to Jesus Christ’s invitation with your words, trusting in His care.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Receive peace like a gift. Imagine handing Jesus your burdens.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ask Jesus to lead and teach you; submit to His way.</p></li></ul><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lord Jesus, thank you for the rest You promise when I come to you. Please help me to turn to You. Refresh my exhausted soul and relieve me of the load that weighs me down. Please guide me and teach me. Amen.</p>

      <title>Family Business</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/8/16/family-business</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>"In everything that he undertook ... he sought his God and worked wholeheartedly.&nbsp;And so he prospered."&nbsp;(2 Chronicles 31:21)</em>&nbsp;</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With summer ending, I am reminded that God has not promised an eternal&nbsp;vacation. He has promised to meet our needs and guide us into an abundant life through a relationship with Him. Work is one way in which God grows these promises to fruition.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Work is any place where you add value,&nbsp;whether that is nurturing the souls within your family or influencing thousands of people. From a kingdom perspective, work is not about position, power, or even a paycheck. Work is an opportunity to reveal the heart and ways of your Heavenly Father.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Consider that Jesus ran His Father's business here on earth. How? He stayed close to His Father. Likewise, Christ tells us to abide in His love for apart from Him we can do nothing (John 15:1-17).&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God has not called us to productivity as the world preaches. He has not asked us to create a 5-year plan or pursue&nbsp;something bigger or better. He has called us to abide in Christ. In this pursuit through scripture, prayer, and obedience, we create friendship with the Lord which yields true value.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You too have been assigned a role in your Heavenly Father's family business. He has asked you to be salt and light to the people in your sphere of influence. Cultivate&nbsp;a close friendship with&nbsp;the Lord and He will produce through your work what pleases Him, blesses you, and truly benefits others.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reflection</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. Am I praying daily for God's wisdom? Do I follow through on what He reveals?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. Do I work on what God leads me to do and with my best effort?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">May God's favor rest upon you&nbsp;as You seek Him and work wholeheartedly in your current role.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer:</span></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father God, I praise You for making my work count. Please help me to abide in Your love and work with an awareness of Your Spirit so that others may encounter Your goodness. Thank You for working on my behalf as I seek and serve You. In Jesus Christ's name I pray. Amen.</p>

  <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“I thank my God every time I remember you. In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now, being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.” (Philippians 1:3-6)</em></p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God is not a quitter. He is altogether different from our nature. The One who <em>“uses his powerful word to hold all things together”</em> (Hebrews 1:3a) will not grow weary of calling you to share His gospel.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.” (Ephesians 2:10)</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Everywhere you go, whether to the grocery store or to a foreign nation, God has designed, called, and prepared you to reveal Christ. <em>“You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit—fruit that will last—”</em> (John 15:16a)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Your role in this partnership with the Holy Spirit is to ‘place &amp; embrace.’ <em>“Take your everyday, ordinary life—your sleeping, eating, going-to-work, and walking-around life—and place it before God as an offering. Embracing what God does for you is the best thing you can do for him.” (Romans 12:1-2 MSG)</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Next, <em>“fix your attention on God.” </em>(Romans 12:1-2 MSG) This passage goes on to promise that God’s grace will enable you to discern and quickly respond to what He wants you to do. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Not only will this bear good fruit to feed others spiritually, but you will grow to be more like Jesus Christ. <em>“God brings the best out of you, develops well-formed maturity in you.”</em> (Romans 12:1-2 MSG) This is good news!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">By placing your life before God, embracing His grace, and fixing your attention on Him, you position yourself for Holy Spirit to do a powerful work through your life. Regardless, God will never quit His perfect work in you. (Phil. 1:3-6) May you trust that Jesus Christ is at work, choosing and lovingly embracing you as His partner in sharing the gospel.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reflection</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How will I fix my attention on God today? With whom is God calling me to share Jesus?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God, thank You for wanting to bring the best out of me. I place my everyday life before You and embrace Your unfailing love. Lord Jesus, make me more mindful of You. Amen.</p>

      <title>A Word Went Out</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2023/9/19/a-word-went-out</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture:</span></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>"At the beginning of your pleas for mercy a word went out,&nbsp;and I have come to tell it to you, for&nbsp;you are greatly loved."</em> (Daniel 9:23a)</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God leans in when His children's prayers are fueled by His Word. Look how the Lord responded to Daniel after he <em>"perceived in the books"</em> and <em>"turned [his] face to the Lord God."</em>&nbsp;(Dan. 9:2-3) God sent the angel Gabriel to convey His delight and love&nbsp;for Daniel!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God responded to Daniel's faith-filled, scripture-soaked prayer with the message:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>"...you are greatly loved."</em> (Dan. 9:23 ESV)</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>"...you are very precious&nbsp;to God."</em> (Dan. 9:23 NLT)</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>"...you are of great value in God's sight."</em> (Dan. 9:23 NET)</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Get the gist? When we pray trusting God's character with minds full of His very words, it is as if we are speaking heaven’s language. But why would this delight God?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One reason is that God elevates His character and His Word above everything else. "<em>I bow down toward your holy temple and give thanks to your name for your steadfast love and your faithfulness, for you have exalted above all things your name and your word."</em>&nbsp;(Psalm 138:2) Daniel, a man of the Word, begins his prayer with this same adoration, modeling one of the Bible’s most inspiring prayers.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Like Daniel, we understand God reveals His character by fulfilling His promises. It is a matter of when, not if God will keep His Word. Confidence in God's character did not lull Daniel to rest, rather it compelled him to earnestly pray. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God's holiness in contrast to Daniel’s sin and the sin of his people, weighed heavily on Daniel's heart. He pleaded earnestly for God's mercy. He professed God's character and confessed wickedness. Daniel prayed for the sake of God’s name, His glory (Dan. 9:4-19).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God hears your prayers because of His great mercy and desires to shine upon you (Dan. 9:17). He feels tremendous compassion, and desires to give insight and understanding. For you are greatly loved, very precious, and of great value to God (Dan. 9:22-23). Fueled&nbsp;by His Word, may you pray trusting God’s character and for His glory.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reflection</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. Do I set aside time to dialogue with God about what I read in Scripture?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. What do I need to take to God with confidence in His character &amp; His Word?</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer:</span></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You for listening and responding to my prayers. Please forgive me and Your people the ways we disregard You. I ask for Holy Spirit to teach me to pray like Daniel so that You are glorified. I pray in the merciful name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

  <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“I continued watching in the night visions, and suddenly one like a son of man was coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was escorted before him. He was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, so that those of every people, nation, and language should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will not be destroyed.” (Daniel 7:13-14)</em></p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Daniel Chapter 7 begins like a nightmare. Terrorizing beasts rising from the sea is not exactly the stuff that inspires devotionals. But Daniel’s terrifying vision is the perfect pitch-black backdrop to display Christ’s glorious appearance.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Today God’s enemy comes to <em>“wear out the saints of the Most High.”</em> (Daniel 7:25) Although we cannot fathom this persecution before Christ’s return, you have met darkness designed to wear you out.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The spirit behind the antichrist in Daniel 7 schemes to oppose your faith and demand attention (see 2 Thessalonians 2:4). Yet, no matter how the enemy attempts to wear you down, he cannot wear down the Holy Spirit within you.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross. And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.”</em> (Colossians 2:13-15)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">All demonic powers were defeated by the cross of Christ. And the Holy Spirit, who indwells your heart through faith, imparts to you God’s strength to face down lingering spiritual opposition. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“… the glory-strength God gives. It is strength that endures the unendurable and spills over into joy, thanking the Father who makes us strong enough to take part in everything bright and beautiful that he has for us.” </em>(Col. 1:9-12 MSG)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As in Daniel’s vision, spiritual darkness will highlight Christ’s presence in your life as you rely on Him. Praise God the final consummation of evil will one day end (Dan. 7:26-27)! There is an incredibly happy ending on the way.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reflection:</span></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. In what ways does darkness attempt to wear out your faith?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. Where do you turn for relief?</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer:</span></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You for Daniel’s brilliant vision of Lord Jesus. Help me to live for Your glory that everyone around me might come to know Christ. I ask for grace to rely on Your victorious strength to overcome darkness. I love You, God. It is in Jesus’ name I pray. Amen.</p>

      <title>Breakthrough</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2024/1/11/breakthrough</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture:</strong><br><em>“In the morning, Lord, you hear my voice; in the morning, I lay my requests before you and wait expectantly.”</em> (Psalm 5:3)<br><br><strong>Reading:</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our loved one was digging a pit deeper into the darkness. This person’s mindset and situation had grown to such a degree that I no longer believed change was possible with our help.<br><br>Heartbroken, I surrendered to the reality that this was out of our control. We continued to pray, yet I could not shake the unction to fast and pray. The idea seemed to repeatedly float to the surface of my thoughts. <em>“Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen: to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke?”</em> (Isaiah 58:6)<br><br>My loved one’s freedom and inner healing were my heart’s constant cry. I knew deep in my core that the promises in the following verses of Isaiah 58 were the Lord’s intention. I yielded to God and committed to fasting and praying.<br><br>I chose a day of the week to fast from sundown to sundown. As I had breaks in my day, I locked myself in a room with a list of scriptures I prayed aloud specifically for my loved one – week after week, month after month. I want to make clear that others had been praying over the course of the year as well.<br><br>‘Breakthrough’ is too simple of a word to express what happened one gray December afternoon. I had said goodbye to my loved one, and experienced such anguish over their direction that the carpet under my knees was wet with tears. Within the hour, they unexpectedly appeared at my door after what can only be described as a move of God on their behalf. Within 24 hours, a complete shift began unfolding.<br><br>Much time has since passed, and my loved one is experiencing the goodness of God for themselves – freedom and inner healing. The trajectory of their life is moving in a completely different direction to God’s glory. To say the least, my thanksgiving has not ended.<br><br>By committing to an intentional time of fasting and praying scripture I also found personal relief. The repeated surrendering to the Lord, allowing Him to minister to me as well during those beautiful breaks with Him yielded more than I could ask or imagine.<br><br>As we begin this new year, I feel a renewed call to fast and pray for a multitude of situations and dreams. Perhaps you too are sensing an invitation to withdraw from the world to be with God. My prayer for you is to be renewed through fasting and praying, and to see a breakthrough flowing from His throne of grace. <em>“Then you will call, and the LORD will answer; you will cry for help, and he will say: Here am I.”</em> (Isaiah 58:9)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Application:</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. Do you have a repetitive thought about fasting and praying? What is it?<br>2. Commit to that action for a period of your choosing. Ask the Lord to minister to you, and to move on behalf of the people and situations that are of concern to you.<br><br><strong>Prayer:</strong><br>O LORD, in the morning You hear my voice. I look around and ahead with expectant faith. Lead me, Lord, and make Your way straight before me. I take refuge in You and rejoice. It is in Jesus’ powerful name I pray. Amen. (Psalm 5)</p>

      <title>Wisdom</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2024/1/25/wisdom</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span><em>:</em></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Whoever claims to live in him must live as Jesus did.”</em>  (1 John 2:6)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading:</span></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Wisdom is a relationship, not a result. Jesus walked, talked, and lived wisdom because of his relationship with his Heavenly Father. Likewise, you can walk, talk, and live wisely if you are in relationship with Jesus Christ.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As a young believer, I had an a-ha moment when a Christian friend revealed that when deciding she asks herself, “What is wise?” In other words, it is wise to first consider not what popculture or your neighbor may suggest, but what Jesus would do in your situation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Through the gospels we see Jesus interacting with people. We read His parables, and about His perspectives and practices. We also find He consistently referred people back to God’s Word. He did this because God’s wisdom for humanity is revealed through scripture and its precepts, through Jesus <em>“the Word made flesh.”</em> (John 1:14)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Oh, the depth of the riches… of the wisdom… of God!”</em> (Romans 11:33)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we spend time in God’s company through His Word and prayer and seek godly counsel we are investing in our lives. We grow in wisdom. The fruit of wisdom is a heart fully committed to God. That is a heart God continuously shapes into Christlikeness.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is a lifelong walk with Jesus, following in His steps. How incredible that heavenly wisdom comes from spending time with the Son of God. Be encouraged! As you grow in your relationship with Christ, who is wisdom, your ability to walk, talk, and live wisely will grow as well.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Application:</span></h2><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Is your talk wiser than your walk? What would it take for your walk to line up with your talk?</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Challenge yourself to reading one chapter of Proverbs a day. You will read the entire book by the end of the month. Ask the Holy Spirit to show you how to live what you read.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Read three chapters in the gospels a day starting in Matthew, and you will read all four gospels in 30 days.&nbsp; Ask the Holy Spirit to make scripture come alive to you.</p></li></ol><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer:</span></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father God, Your Word says that <em>“He who walks with the wise grows wise.”</em> (Proverbs 13:20) Lord Jesus, by Your grace I want to know You through scripture, prayer, and the power of Your Spirit to such a degree that I grow wise. I fully commit my heart to You. I pray this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

      <title>Disciple Maker</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2024/10/15/disciple-maker</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“’Go, therefore, and make disciples&nbsp;of all nations,&nbsp;baptizing&nbsp;them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, </em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.’”</em> (Matthew 28:19-20)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God has a way for you to make disciples that fits your unique personality and daily interactions. Scripture implies your leading others to Christ is intended to be a natural extension of your relationship with Him rather than a duty.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Take, for instance, Lois and Eunice. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“I am reminded of your sincere faith,&nbsp;which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice&nbsp;and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also.”</em> (2 Timothy 1:5)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When Paul wrote these words from a dank prison cell, he was not referring to Timothy’s family traditions. Rather, he was recalling the example of these women. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">These ladies’ day-to-day interactions and conversations communicated faith and obedience to Christ. This was the catalyst for Timothy’s sincere faith. These women were contagious disciple-makers.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When a Samaritan woman told her neighbors about her encounter with Jesus, enthusiasm was not something she worked up. Her experience became a part of who she was and naturally flowed into conversations. After interacting with this contagious woman, scripture says people were compelled to reach Jesus.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“’Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?’ They left the town and made their way to him.” </em>(John 4:29-30)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This flow is the joyful, natural disciple-making Jesus commands. Love God by allowing the volition of your relationship with Jesus to roll into your everyday interactions. Love others by fueling their trust in Christ. Love your life as you partner with the Holy Spirit in being a faithful disciple-maker.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Describe an interaction with someone that drew you in and piqued your interest. What was contagious about that person?</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">By devoting time to scripture and prayer God will grow your relationship with Jesus. Making disciples will become a natural extension of who you are.</p></li></ol><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father God, according to Your Word, You have commissioned me to make disciples in my coming and going. I want to be a faithful witness. I pray for Your grace to lead others to Jesus. Make me a contagious Christian, Lord. Amen.</p>

      <title>The Pursuit of Success or the Pursuit of Contentment?</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2024/10/21/the-pursuit-of-success-or-the-pursuit-of-contentment</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture:<br> </strong><em>"I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances... I can do all this through him who gives me strength."<br> </em>—Philippians 4:11-13 (NIV)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Biblical Context:<br> </strong>Paul’s letter to the Philippians was written from a place of personal hardship—imprisonment. Yet, Paul speaks of contentment not based on his external circumstances but through his deep reliance on Christ. Paul contrasts worldly success and material wealth with the peace that comes from trusting in God's provision. His contentment was a result of knowing that his life, purpose, and well-being were in God’s hands, not dependent on his achievements or comfort.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Devotional:<br> </strong>In our culture, we often equate success with contentment. We pursue career advancement, financial security, and personal accomplishments, believing that we will finally feel at peace once we reach certain milestones. But more often than not, after achieving these goals, the sense of satisfaction is fleeting, and we find ourselves chasing the next achievement, hoping it will bring lasting fulfillment.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Success, as the world defines it, can never fully satisfy our hearts because we were made for something greater—something eternal. Paul’s secret to contentment, as he describes in Philippians 4, was not rooted in his circumstances but in Christ. He had learned that contentment comes from knowing and trusting God, no matter the situation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But this doesn’t mean that ambition or goals are inherently wrong. God has a purpose for our lives, and He places visions and desires within our hearts. These desires often drive us to pursue meaningful work, to seek excellence, and to make a difference in the world. However, we must seek to understand how those goals fit into God’s greater kingdom purpose. </p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><strong><em>True contentment comes when the desires God places in our hearts align with our everyday actions toward making a Kingdom impact.</em></strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Proverbs 16:9 tells us, <em>“In their hearts humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their steps.”</em> While we may have ambitions, goals, and dreams, we must continually bring them before God, asking Him to shape and direct them according to His will. When we do this, we align ourselves with His greater plan for our lives. Our work, relationships, and personal pursuits become expressions of His Kingdom purposes rather than mere achievements for personal gain.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When our hearts and actions are aligned with God's vision, we begin to experience true contentment. This contentment is not tied to whether we achieve every goal on our list or reach a certain level of success. Instead, it is rooted in knowing that we are faithfully walking in the path God has laid out for us, contributing to His Kingdom in ways both large and small.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This alignment doesn’t necessarily mean we will always be comfortable or free from challenges. But it does mean we can have peace, knowing that our lives are part of something greater than our individual success. We are working for eternal purposes, building a legacy that extends far beyond our time on earth.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To live this way requires continual surrender. We must be willing to let go of goals that are purely self-serving and allow God to redefine success for us. As we seek Him, we will find that true contentment flows not from what we achieve but from living in step with His purposes, trusting that His plan is greater than anything we could accomplish on our own.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Application:<br> </strong>This week, take time to reflect on the goals and ambitions that drive your life. Are these desires aligned with God’s Kingdom purposes, or are they rooted in a pursuit of personal success? Bring your goals before God and ask Him to reveal how they fit into His greater plan. Seek contentment not in the achievement of these goals but in the daily process of living out God’s purpose for your life.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer:<br> </strong>"Lord, thank You for the desires and visions You have placed in my heart. Help me to understand how these desires fit into Your Kingdom purpose. Align my goals with Your will, and teach me to find contentment in living out Your plan for my life. May my actions each day reflect a heart surrendered to You and committed to making an eternal impact. Amen."</p>

      h-amp-humility</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture: </span></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”</em> (Matthew 5:3)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God honors humility. The world honors self-reliance. Whose honor do you want to experience?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It takes humility to believe in God, to trust Him, and depend on Him like a child. Certainly, Holy Spirit’s grace sounds ideal, yet the quick fix of worldly praise is alluring. This quick fix is exactly what leads us to worship ourselves, rather than our Creator.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"Humility is nothing but the disappearance of self in the vision that God is all." Andrew Murray’s definition from his classic work <span style="text-decoration:underline">Humility</span> is a refreshing thought. To lose ourselves in recognition of God’s majesty and holiness is to be free from the bondage of self-worship. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Consider these thoughts to navigate your way to deeper humility and faith.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>1. Humility perceives oneself in the light of Christ</strong>. John Flavel wrote, “They that know God will be humble; they that know themselves cannot be proud.” Humble yourself before God. He offers grace to free you from the bondage of pride and unbelief. <em>“God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.” </em>(James 4:6)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>2. Humility reflects Jesus.</strong> Scripture reveals Jesus as meek, humble, and gentle (Matthew 5:5, 21:5). Consider the humility of Christ the King, who sent His Spirit to live in you, His beloved, simple jar of clay (John 15:26, 2 Corinthians 4:7). We are instructed to put on this very humility of Jesus with the realization that He alone is God (Colossians 3:12).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>3. Humility reveals Christ to others</strong>. Humility is not an outward show. It is the inner realization of a lack of merit before God. Out of gratitude for God’s mercy, serve Him by serving people, His image bearers. Reveal Christ’s gospel through practical manifestations of His love.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Paul put it this way: <em>“I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me.&nbsp;The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God,&nbsp;who loved&nbsp;me&nbsp;and gave himself&nbsp;for me.”</em> (Galatians 2:20) What a clear picture of the humility and faith that God honors.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ask God to replace your pride and unbelief with humility and faith.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What can you do to gain a clearer perspective of God’s majesty and holiness?</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In what ways can you faithfully serve God by serving others?</p></li></ol><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father God, I do believe. Please grant me grace to live like it with humility. I pray for a correct perspective of myself in Your light. Please reflect and reveal Christ through me to others. In Christ’s name and for Your glory I pray. Amen.</p>

      <title>Enthusiasm &amp;amp; Empowerment</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2024/11/21/enthusiasm-amp-empowerment</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“His power… is at work within us.”</em> (Eph. 3:20)	</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“So, my dear brothers and sisters, be strong and immovable. Always work enthusiastically for the Lord, for you know that nothing you do for the Lord is ever useless”</em> (1 Corinthians 15:58 NLT)	</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What lights you up? What makes you feel enthusiastic?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The word <em>enthusiasm</em> comes from two Greek words that mean “in” and “God.” Quite literally, the word means “full of God!” Zeal. Eager. Whole-heartedness.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In God, enthusiasm for what is good and right and true (2 Chronicles 31:20) is a fruit of His sanctifying work in your life. You have been set apart. <em>“…&nbsp;that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.”</em> (1 Peter 2:9)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God, who never sleeps nor slumbers, is constantly shaping His children. <em>“…for&nbsp;it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for&nbsp;his good pleasure.”</em>&nbsp; (Philippians 2:13)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Holy Spirit, the Counselor, the Spirit of truth sanctifies you. He protects you. He restores you. He empowers you. And in Christ, He will fuel you with enthusiasm that testifies you have been with Him. (John 15:26-27)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God given enthusiasm empowers you to:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">partner with Jesus in His redemptive story (John 15:4-5, 1 Corinthians 3:9)</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">restore order from chaos (Genesis 2:15, Psalm 34:14)</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">invest in others (Philippians 2:3, Matthew 20:28-32)</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And the Lord is enthusiastic about you! In God there is unlimited enthusiasm available to you. In partnership with His will, His empowerment will overflow to you until that day you stand before Him with an enthusiasm incomprehensible (John 15:11)!</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Recall a time when you were particularly enthusiastic. What does your relationship with God and others look like when you are enthusiastic about where the Lord has led you?</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Positive thinking is not enough to stay enthusiastic. You must be aware of the Lord, not temporary factors. What spiritual practices help you abide in God?</p></li></ol><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father God, I welcome Your work in my life. I pray for enthusiasm for the good work You have prepared for me to do today. You are able to do above and beyond all that I ask or think according to the power that works in me – to Christ be all the glory. Amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“This is what the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;says: ‘Cursed are those who put their trust in mere humans, who rely on human strength and turn their hearts away from the&nbsp;Lord. They are like stunted shrubs in the desert,&nbsp;with no hope for the future. They will live in the barren wilderness,&nbsp;in an uninhabited salty land. But blessed are those who trust in the&nbsp;Lord and have made the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;their hope and confidence. They are like trees planted along a riverbank, with roots that reach deep into the water. Such trees are not bothered by the heat&nbsp;or worried by long months of drought. Their leaves stay green, and they never stop producing fruit.” </em>(Jeremiah 17:5-8)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Human strength will wither and waste away. Stunted, without hope; these are not words we want to describe our lives.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“But blessed are those who trust in the&nbsp;Lord and have made the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;their hope and confidence.” </em>(Jer. 17:7)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jeremiah described people whose whole trust is in God as blessed, happily one with Him. He described these thriving lives like trees planted close to a river. Their roots grow deep, covered and flourishing in the water. Security, vibrancy, and meaning are the results of this oneness. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus invites all people to this river of life, to plant our lives in Him. His invitation is to oneness with God. He welcomes you into the same closeness He has with His heavenly Father. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“</em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>I pray that they will all be one, just as you and I are one—as you are in me, Father, and I am in you. And may they be in us so that the world will believe you sent me.”</em> (John 17:21)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You are not meant to <em>“live in the barren wilderness,&nbsp;in an uninhabited salty land</em>. …<em>bothered by the heat&nbsp;or worried by long months of drought.</em>”<em> </em>(Jer. 17:6,8) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Rather, through oneness with God, you are meant to be nourished by His living water. Your life is to bear blessing, hope, and eternal confidence leading others also into oneness with the Lord.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Such trees are</em> <em>not bothered by the heat&nbsp;or worried by long months of drought. Their leaves stay green, and they never stop producing fruit.” </em>(Jer. 17:8)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Like a tree planted along a riverbank, draw from the Lord. Make Him your source of hope and confidence. Soul secure, reliant on His strength, bearing His good fruit. This is life in the&nbsp;Lord, oneness with God.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. Meditate on the immense goodness of God surrounding you and in you through His Spirit. Entrust every aspect of your life to Him.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. God designed you to live joined to the Lord, one spirit with Him<em> </em>(1 Corinthians 6:17). Using your own words, accept the Lord’s invitation into oneness with Him.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>: </h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lord Jesus, in You I live and move and have my being. Teach me how to abide deeply in You that Your Spirit may reveal Your goodness to the world. I want to be one with You in every area of my life, God. Amen.</p>

      <title>Hope</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2024/12/10/hope</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace&nbsp;as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.”</em> (Romans 15:13)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading:</span></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Don’t tell my teenagers, but I still tuck them into bed. As I rub their backs and move hair away from their faces, I remind them that according to scripture they are chosen, dearly loved, rejoiced over, set apart for God’s purposes and uniquely gifted, fearfully and wonderfully made. They are precious in God’s sight and my own.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Magnifying what God says fuels our hope – my children’s and my own. Christian hope is the confident expectation that God is faithful to fulfill what He has started. Understand that hope is not ordinary. It is not happy optimism. Hope is how Jesus saw people, circumstances, and the future.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus still views us through a lens of hope knowing who we are created to be in union with the Father. He is sovereign over circumstances that form us and reveal God’s glory. He foresees the future with confidence knowing God’s purposes will be fulfilled. He is <em>“the God of hope.” </em>(Romans 15:13)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you have been redeemed by Christ, then you have hope. If you have experienced restoration after fragmenting sin, then you have hope. If your heart has been resurrected by God’s transforming work, then you have hope. Hope is God at work in your life. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Holy Spirit imparts His hope as a glimpse of what eternity will be like in His light.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God’s Word speaks over your life just like a parent nurturing hope in a child. Focus on what God has declared and allow your soul to magnify the Lord. Hope is with you, actively preparing you for a wonderful future with Jesus.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. Where do you sense God working in your life? What makes you feel hopeful right now? </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. In prayer, agree with what God’s Word says about you. Imagine Jesus viewing you through His all-knowing lens of hope, His guidance, His promises for you. Nothing is impossible for God (Jeremiah 32:17, Job 42:2). Ask God to fuel confident expectation of His good plan for you.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father, You are God, and I am not. I agree that what You say about me is eternal truth. I am dependent on You and thankful for Your constant work in my life. In our union, I pray for Your hope to overflow to me and through me. In Jesus’ mighty name, amen.</p>

      <title>Peace</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2024/12/19/peace</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.” </em>(Isaiah 9:6)</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is no denying a river. Standing next to a mighty river like the Yellowstone or the lesser known Rivanna River near my home, I could never change their courses. However, whether a man made damn or a beaver’s, a blockage could change how I experience the river. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The same is true for the spiritual blessings that flow from God to His children. Gifts like hope, joy, and peace are continually available for Christ’s followers, but there can be blessing blockers. Their names are unending but typically they share the middle name “unbelief” and end with the surname “sin.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Every name of Jesus eradicates these blessing blockers. <em>“Prince of Peace”</em> names the wellspring of our souls, the Source of our well-being and welfare. The regal title assures us that Jesus has the authority and power to care for and protect the citizens of His Kingdom (Philippians 3:20). </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As an adopted child of God through faith in Christ, Jesus’ peace supernaturally flows like a river to your soul (Isaiah 48:18). Constant. Powerful. Abundant. Lasting peace belongs to Jesus the Prince of Peace, and it is His alone to bestow. Because we are incapable of creating our own peace, Jesus offers us His. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The means of experiencing His peace comes by redirecting your mind to God (Isaiah 26:3). Trusting Jesus and living obediently is the conduit. “<em>If only you had paid attention to my commands, your peace would have been like a river, your righteousness like the waves of the sea.” </em>(Isaiah 48:18)<em> </em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus, Prince of Peace, reveals Himself to those who obey and depend on Him. Jesus said, <em>“Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.”</em> (John 14:21) The Amplified Bible translation says, <em>“I will make Myself real to him.”</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Immanuel, God with You, cares for you. He is the Good Shephard. Lean into the Prince of Peace. There will be no denying His flow of peace to your soul.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Peace I leave with you;&nbsp;my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you.&nbsp;Let not your hearts be troubled, neither&nbsp;let them be afraid.” </em>(John 14:27)</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. What might be blocking the Lord’s flow of peace to your soul? Pour out your heart before the Lord for He is your refuge from these things (Psalm 62:8).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. After surrendering what is on your heart and mind, tell Jesus why you love Him. Allow His peace to flow to you and fill your soul.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Prayer</strong></span><strong>:</strong></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You for moving me out of darkness and into Your marvelous light. I surrender what clouds my awareness of You. I confess my unbelief and sin. In their place, I receive Your peace. In the name of the Prince of Peace, I pray. Amen.</p>

      <title>Anger</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2024/2/27/anger</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Do not repay anyone evil for evil.&nbsp;Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone.</em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.”</em> (Romans 12:17-18)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have you struggled with forgiving someone? I certainly have. Feeling overcome with anger because of a misunderstanding, misinformation, or mistreatment is not easy. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Whether valid or not, unchecked anger is destructive. If left ungoverned, you can count on one thing in this broken world – more broken things, including broken relationships. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Freedom from emotional bondage such as anger is possible. God desires to bring peace where there has been sin. <em>“Trust in the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding…”</em> (Proverbs 3:5) Scripture calls us to replace our natural response of anger with forgiveness.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Forgiveness becomes a bit easier when you realize it helps you. Forgiveness frees you from the control of the one who hurt you. It welcomes the love of God to purge your mind and emotions from anger.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Bear with each other&nbsp;and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.” </em>(Col. 3:13) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Lord will deal with all injustice in His time and in His way (Proverbs 15:1). No matter your circumstance, it is never too late to release yourself from the bondage of anger. Your part is to put away anger by surrendering your situation to God and forgive.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Application</span>:</h1><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Examine your heart. Do you want to be Christlike?</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In prayer, release your rights to be justified and entrust your situation to the Lord. Ask God to empower you to forgive.</p></li></ol><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father God, thank You for extending mercy and grace toward me. You faithfully work in my life to transform me to be like Jesus. Please help me to control my anger, bring offenses to You, and be quick to forgive. In Jesus Christ’s name, I pray. Amen.</p>

      <title>Love</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2024/2/7/love</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Love is patient and&nbsp;kind; love&nbsp;does not envy or boast; it&nbsp;is not arrogant&nbsp;or rude. It&nbsp;does not insist on its own way; it&nbsp;is not irritable or resentful;</em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>it&nbsp;does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but&nbsp;rejoices with the truth.&nbsp;Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things,&nbsp;endures all things.</em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Love never ends.” </em>(1 Corinthians 13:4-8)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Don’t talk about my friend that way.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I was shocked. It took me a moment to realize my coffee companion was referring to what I was saying about myself. We do that at times, don’t we? With impatience, we speak unkindly and with resentment about ourselves. We forget to love ourselves like God.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How does God love us? He consistently and constantly loves like a champion father. Consider when a toddler is learning to walk or a child is learning to ride a bike, what does a great father do? He loves. He is patient and kind, not rude or irritable. He rejoices with the child’s attempt, protecting, believing, and hoping for what is to come. And he does not quit.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That is love.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That is the difference between human love and God’s love. We cannot love ourselves or our neighbors like God – consistently and constantly – without His Holy Spirit. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Everyone’s personal history has failed attempts to love well because we tend to rely on our own nature. Our own nature is far from holy, and if we follow our flesh, it will lead us through life with a limp. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That is why Christ gave you the Holy Spirit as your Helper when you placed your trust in Him as Savior. He also gave us a new commandment.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>“</em></strong><em>A new commandment&nbsp;I give to you,&nbsp;that you love one another:&nbsp;just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.”</em> (John 13:34)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How has Jesus loved you? Consistently and constantly. Patiently and kindly. He is not arrogant or rude. He does not even insist on His own way in your life. He rejoices over you because you have received Him as Lord. He covers you with Himself, believes, hopes, and endures with you.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When you tell your mind the truth about God’s love for you, it transforms your heart to genuinely love God, yourself, and others. This <em>“faith working through love” </em>is how we come to <em>“love your neighbor as yourself.”</em> (Galatians 5:6; 13-14) Receiving God’s love for you and expressing that to others is truly what matters. </p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Application</span>:</h1><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The first word God, who is love, uses to describe Himself is <em>patient</em>, then <em>kind</em>. (1 Cor. 13:4) How has God been patient and kind toward you? Allow this truth to convert your heart to patience and kindness toward yourself and others.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Love is not tolerance for error, but rather <em>“rejoices in the truth.”</em> (1 Cor. 13:6) Do not tolerate unloving thoughts. Instead, share with God what is bothering you. Ask to see it in the light of His loving character and conduct.</p></li></ol><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You for loving me. I pray to love with the patience and kindness of Jesus. Help me to celebrate Your grace to others and be content with the grace You have given to me. Please deliver me from envying, boasting, arrogance, and rudeness. Please mark my life with Your love, God. In Christ I pray. Amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Scripture</strong></span><strong>:</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’” </em>(Matthew 22:37-39)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Reading</strong></span><strong>:</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Ready. Set. Go!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">These commands mark the beginning of any great race. At the shout of “ready” runners prepare to give their all, setting their sights on the finish line.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus also gave a command to those of us who <em>“…run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith.” </em>(Hebrew 12:1-2)</p><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">Nearing the end of Jesus’ own earthly race leaders of Judaism strategized to test and tempt Jesus. One of these men asked which of the 613 commandments is the most important. Jesus answered with the most recognized commandment in the Law, the Shema.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment.” </em>(Matthew 22:27-38)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christians love God when our thinking and desires compel us to run our race obeying God. This is not an arbitrary moral idea. When you choose to obey God’s principles, you embody His nature. You love according to His will.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus then said to the leaders, <em>“And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’” </em>(Matt. 22:39)</p><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">Today cease from thinking that your knowledge of God equates loving Him. Instead, prepare yourself to follow what Jesus asks of you. Ask Him to help you embody His love. My friend in Christ, you are ready, set to go!</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Application</strong></span><strong>:</strong></h1><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In what situation do you need to choose God’s will over your own?</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As you interact with others, consider their needs. Is there a way to put them before yourself? </p></li></ol><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Prayer:</strong></span></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Thank You, Jesus Christ, for perfectly running Your race, pioneering the way to God for me. I want to love God with my whole being. Your Word says, <em>“Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>sister.” </em>(1 John 4:21) I ask for grace to obey You and seek the greatest good of others. Amen.</p>

      <title>Self-Preservation</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2024/3/26/self-preservation</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Then he went out to the gateway, where another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, ‘This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.’</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>He denied it again, with an oath: ‘I don’t know the man!’” </em>(Matthew 26:71-72) </p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Did you eat the last cookie?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Uh, no,” mumbled the child with the cookie crumb lips.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Self-preservation. Sometimes it benefits us, other times not so much. It is inspired by fear, and fear is a lousy guide.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I bet the apostle Peter’s mother would have described her impulsive boy as anything but fearful. Think about how he responded to Jesus throughout the gospels. When Jesus called, Peter immediately followed. When Jesus called, Peter walked on water. When Jesus called, Peter proclaimed, <em>“You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.” </em>(Matt. 16:16)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Yet at the end of Jesus’ ministry, when fear called, Peter denied knowing Jesus. Instead of being confident and courageous, Peter succumbed to self-preservation. “<em>He denied it again, with an oath: ‘I don’t know the man!’” </em>(Matt. 26:71-72)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Remember, this is the disciple who led the way in declaring he would die with Jesus. <em>“Peter said to him, ‘Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you!” And all the disciples said the same.’” </em>(Matt. 26:35)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Like Peter, we have all turned away from God at some point. But do you know who did not turn away and choose self-preservation in the face of fear? Jesus, the Son of God, who could have called upon thousands of angels to rescue Him (Matt. 26:53). He chose to not save Himself, but rather submitted to death to save you.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When fear draws you away from being a friend of Jesus, suggesting you had better save yourself, what should you do? What is a better way to respond when your own dreams are crucified?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Look up from your day to see it is Jesus who cares for you in the middle of the madness. Like Peter He is looking at you, knows every detail, and loves you, calling you by name. Praise God for moments that reveal you cannot save yourself. Your Savior is Christ alone.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. &nbsp; When has fear tempted you to back away from Jesus?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. &nbsp; As Jesus awaited Peter on a beach to restore him in His love, the Lord is always there for you. How will you respond?</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You for Your constant saving grace. Please strengthen me as a friend of Jesus when I am tempted to turn away in fear. I ask for Your guidance and strength. I love you, Lord. Amen.</p>

      <title>A Little Further</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2024/4/10/a-little-further</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“But you are my witnesses, O Israel!” says the LORD. “You are my servant. You have been chosen to know me, believe in me, and understand that I alone am God. There is no other God— there never has been, and there never will be.” </em>(Isaiah 43:10)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And you will be my witnesses, telling people about me everywhere—in Jerusalem, throughout Judea, in Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” </em>(Acts 1:8)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Please don’t call on me. Please don’t call on me. Please don’t call on me.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have you ever sat in a classroom or meeting hoping not to be called on? Likely, you know that same thought can creep into opportunities to share your faith.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Instead, you must worship Christ as Lord of your life. And if someone asks about your hope as a believer, always be ready to explain it.”</em> (1 Peter 3:15)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Whatever the setting, if you trust Christ and serve God, people will ask about your hope. It may sound more like an observation such as, “I don’t know how you do it,” or, “You’re so peaceful.” However someone notices the Spirit in your life, consider it a divine appointment to give a gentle answer.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Remember, Jesus came to seek and to save the lost; to reconcile people to God the Father. You have been given the same mission, and there is no greater love than to lay down your life for your friends. Sharing your faith is about loving God and loving people.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is encouraging to remember that when we share our faith, the rest is God’s work. We are not to judge or save, just simply to witness. And talking about what you have experienced or what you know of Jesus is a natural expression of spending time with Him.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus said, <em>“I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.”</em> (John 15:5) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Living with Christ as Lord of your life, you are equipped to move someone a little closer to God. Go about your day listening to be “called on.” God will reward you with the gift of faith and joy confirming that He is moving through you to reach others.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ask God for His love for people. Trust Him to give you words that reveal Christ.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Try referring to your faith in Christ during a conversation today.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Point out God in something good. For example: a blessing, a good work, something beautiful.</p></li></ol><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You for those who told me about Jesus and Your love. I ask for boldness to share the gospel and trust You for words that reveal Christ. In Jesus’ name, I pray. Amen.</p>

      <title>Using Time</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2024/4/25/using-time</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Pay careful attention, then, to how you walk — not as unwise people but as wise — making the most of the time, because the days are evil. So don’t be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is.” </em>(Ephesians 5:15-17)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Uses time wisely.” That is not exactly the testimony of my report cards. Seated next to a window, the curiosities that drew my attention as an elementary student regularly won.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Who decides what is a wise use of time anyway? Authority wins here – teachers, bosses, toddlers. I joke with the latter, but the demands of life are a reality. When we answer who or what is our authority, we gain a better understanding of how to use time.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christians believe God created the concept of time for His creation (Genesis 1:14-19). He is the authority of time. It is naïve to think we can master it. Truly, only our thoughts and actions are the pieces we control.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With God’s authority in mind the New Testament emphasizes <em>“making the best use of the time.” </em>(Eph. 5:16, Colossians 4:5) In both letters to the Ephesians and Colossians, Paul exhorts us to live wisely, to carefully walk in the light of Jesus. To do so is to use our time wisely as we <em>“try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord.” </em>(Eph. 5:10)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. &nbsp; <em>“…walk — not as unwise people but as wise - …” </em>(Eph. 5:15)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As a follower of Christ, emulate Christ. Diligently pursue and value the wisdom God provides in scripture (Proverbs 2:1-6). Remember, Jesus said the wise build [their lives] on the rock of His Word (Matthew 7:24-27).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. &nbsp; <em>“…making the most of the time…” </em>(Eph.5:16)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“The present evil age” </em>is notorious for distractions (Galatians 1:4). What fritters away your time? Pray about it, then prioritize what God considers important. For example, Jesus prioritized time with the Father by rising early to pray before beginning His day (Mark 1:35).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">3. &nbsp; “…<em>understand what the Lord’s will is.” </em>(Eph. 5:17)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Pursuing God’s wisdom will shape your thoughts, actions, and sharpen your discernment regarding decisions. <em>“Walk as children of light (for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true) and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord.” </em>(Eph. 5:8-10) The Holy Spirit will empower you to emulate Christ and discern what is the best use of time</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. &nbsp; Who or what has authority over your time? What is the evidence that you are using time wisely?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. &nbsp; Give yourself over to thoughts and actions that build your life according to God’s Word. This will take time, just as it took time to build your current life, but by walking in the light you will use time wisely and please God.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God, thank You for being the authority of time. Please help me to prioritize what is important to You. I ask to bear the fruit of light (what is good, right, and true) with the time You have given me. In Jesus Christ’s name I pray. Amen.</p>

      <title>Grief</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2024/5/22/grief</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture:</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>“</em></strong><em>For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven: a time to be born, and a time to die; ... a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;“ </em>(Ecclesiastes 3:2, 4)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reading:</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dad died just short of my 24th birthday. The world considered me an adult, but I still leaned heavily on my dad to navigate life. Speaking at his funeral I read aloud a list of things that continue to remind me of him: the Redskins, cracking peanuts, sailing, to name a few. I could feel the loss of him echo in my soul. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Every family has someone they wish were still here. We are irrevocably changed when the people we love, who loved us, pass into eternity. I have found that <em>“holding firm to the word of life” </em>(Philippians 2:16) helps me to live in our Father’s world where death is a thief. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? praise him, my salvation and my God.” </em>(Psalm 42:11) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">David, who was a shepherd, paints a vivid picture with the words <em>“cast down.” </em>To the ancient Hebrews<em>“cast down” </em>speaks of a wooly sheep, saturated and waterlogged to its skin. Under the weight of the wool, the sheep topples over and is unable to right itself. It takes a good shepherd to restore the sheep. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Your Shepherd <em>“is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.” </em>(Psalm 34:18) In times of grief when you can hardly breathe, God is the strength of your heart and cares for you as one in His pasture (Psalm 73:26, 100:3). He is the <em>“God of all comfort.” </em>(2 Corinthians 1:3-5) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Charles Spurgeon wrote, ”Let your faith reason with your fear and your hope argue with your sorrows.” With the help of the Holy Spirit and prayer, scripture speaks to our sorrow, guides us to lament, and uprights our faith and hope while grieving. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Trust your Shepherd. As you long for your loved one, your grief in Christ’s hands will lighten and the echo will become His voice. There is a great goodness coming to you; a time to heal, a time to laugh, a time to dance, a time for peace (Ecclesiastes 3:1-8).</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Your Turn:</strong></h1><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have you invited God to help you? How is scripture ministering to you?</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Start a list of your person’s characteristics, the special ways they loved you and touched your life. Thank God for the time you had and ask for grace to live in a way that honors your loved one.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Consider joining a GriefShare group for insight and support along with others who are</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">experiencing the intensity of grief.</p></li></ol><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer:</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You that my love for ___ will outlast my pain. Teach me how to live well with the weight of grief. Lord Jesus, thank You for being my good Shepherd and helping me. Amen.</p>

      <title>Pledge</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2024/5/9/elections</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture:</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“’They are all acting contrary to Caesar’s decrees, saying that there is another king—Jesus.’”</em> (Acts 17:7)<br><br>&nbsp;<em>“Our citizenship is in heaven, and we eagerly wait for a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ.”</em> (Philippians 3:20)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reading:</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Imagine the smell of pencil shavings, the crack of a loudspeaker, the scrape of chairs pushed by children happy to stand, and then in unison, young voices declaring, “I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America... ” Your elementary school mornings may have been like mine. I still love our pledge, our flag, our country, and as a maturing Chistian, I also understand my first allegiance is to a king and a kingdom – that is Jesus Christ.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Before Caesars and kings and presidents, there was God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit. <em>“’I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.’”</em> (Revelation 1:8)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> As Christ-followers, God draws us into a devoted love with the King of kings and Lord of lords. Sometimes, however, we are swept off our feet by a lesser god, one that can steal peace, kill relationships, and destroy unity. The temptation is to invest our hope and faith in anything or anyone other than God.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> Aligning yourself with King Jesus is more valuable than the promise a candidate might offer or the confidence an elected official may inspire. This election year when flags and fists are flying, view through the eyes of King Jesus and remember His pledge to the world of his future kingdom. Participate in the privilege of democracy with the security that comes from <em>“the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.”</em>(Philippians 3:8)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Your Turn:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. Pray Philippians 1:9-11 this election season. <em>“And pray this: that your love will keep on growing in &nbsp; knowledge and every kind of discernment, so that you may approve the things that are superior...”</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. Perhaps you need a new hero. Google Christian saints, martyrs, missionary heroes, or influential Christians. Allow the lives of courageous Christ-followers to inspire you. How might the Lord be guiding you to stand for His Kingdom in your area of influence?</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer:</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You that King Jesus has made me a citizen of heaven. As Your ambassador, please help me to be audacious about making Your love visible to those around me. Please guide me in discerning what is excellent and pleasing to You. Amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“…the servants who had drawn the water knew.”</em> (John 2:9)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I lowered myself to my knees. My toddler’s blank expression transformed into a big smile as we met eye to eye. A quick wobble to me and before I knew it her chubby arms wrapped around my neck. Coming down to my child’s level was a joy. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Son of God did something of the sort for us<em>. “Instead he emptied himself by assuming the form of a servant, taking on the likeness of humanity.”</em> (Philippians 2:7) Jesus Christ lived transformed on our level that we might know the power of God’s love. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We see His power come to life in John 2. Jesus was a wedding guest dancing and eating, enjoying life, and welcomed! This was a holy event wholly celebrated - until the hosts ran out of wine. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The wedding in Cana was a community event days longs on the brink of social disaster. It was most definitely an embarrassing situation for the families and could have also resulted in a costly fine. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Mary came to Jesus, not begging or bossing, but confident that He was able to help. She had faith that He knew best and would do what was right. As a result, Jesus transformed water into a superior wine revealing His transformative power. Our Savior loves to cause us joy (Psalm 104:14-15, Galatians 5:22)!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Jesus did this, the first of his signs, in Cana&nbsp;of Galilee.&nbsp;He revealed&nbsp;his glory,&nbsp;and his disciples believed in him.”</em> (John 2:11)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Mary, the disciples, and the servants who served the wine were the only people at the wedding who knew that a miracle had happened. Jesus’ friends knew what He had done. What a drastic shift from faith to seeing, from follower to friend, from working to assisting God in a miracle. This change and renewal is the Lord’s will for all who believe.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“I do not call you servants anymore, because a servant doesn’t know what his master is doing. I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything I have heard from my Father.”</em> (John 15:15) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What a picture of faith and obedience being rewarded! Jesus continues to help us on our level. He bends in your direction continually offering what is best. Are you willing to follow His Word, His will, and His way in return? If so, you are in store for transformation and joy!</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Is there a situation you need to bring to Jesus for transformation? A dryness in your own heart?</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Would you like to be a part of a miracle; what God is doing? Ask Jesus for grace to serve on His behalf and do what He tells you.</p></li></ol><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lord Jesus, thank You for being my source of help. Please transform and renew me from the inside out. I want to be Your servant and friend. Amen.</p>

      <title>Light</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2024/6/5/light</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Life was in Him,&nbsp;and that life was the light of men. That light shines in the darkness, yet the darkness did not overcome&nbsp;it.”</em> (John 1:4-5) </p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Jesus brought life to the spiritually dead and light to the spiritually darkened.”<em> </em>David Platt</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you have placed your trust in Jesus Christ, His Spirit is bearing the fruit of His light through you. This is God’s desire for all of humanity, His image bearers. God longs to restore spiritual light to His creation that withers in darkness.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Scripture tells us Christ’s light is all that is good, right, and true. <em>“For you were once darkness, but now you are light&nbsp;in the Lord. Walk as children of light—</em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>for the fruit of the light consists of all goodness, righteousness, and truth-”</em> (Ephesians 5:8-9)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Not only has Christ rescued you from the domain of spiritual darkness, but now you are to live a life that reflects His goodness, righteousness, and truth. And He wants you to keep company with Him in His light by enjoying Him. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We enjoy the Lord and His light through countless ways – scripture, the beauty of creation, prayer, worship to name a handful. Today, simply take a few minutes to think about Jesus. Focus your attention on who He is, what He has done, and His company with you. As you do qualities that come directly from His Spirit will fill your life and emanate from you – qualities of Christ.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As Jesus said, “‘<em>I am&nbsp;the light&nbsp;of the world. Anyone who follows me will never walk in the darkness but will have the light of life.’”</em> (John 8:12)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christ is shining on you and in you. How often do you intentionally enjoy Him? Your spiritual life will thrive as you practice living with a loving attention fixed on Christ and His light.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How does the image of Jesus Christ shining as light in the darkness speak to you?</p></li></ol><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You for rescuing me from the domain of darkness and giving me new life in Your light. Please open my mind to understand and my heart to respond to the light of Christ Jesus my Savior. Amen.</p>

      <title>Partnering with God</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2024/7/16/partnering-with-god</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Jesus responded to them,&nbsp;‘My Father&nbsp;is still working, and I am working also.’”</em> (John 5:17) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus partnered with His Heavenly Father. Under the same sunshine we see and air we breathe Jesus instantly did what the Father revealed He was doing.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Jesus replied,&nbsp;‘Truly I tell you, the Son is not able to do anything on his own, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, the Son likewise does these things.’”</em> (John 5:19)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus made it clear that not only is He equal to God in authority, but He has power over life and death including eternal judgement (John 5:17-24).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus is God. In his humility He understood his unique role in redeeming humanity (Philippians 2:5-8). Remember that the loving, joyful, peaceful Jesus could not be disproved or destroyed, and only proved His deity over and over, and ultimately by His resurrection. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he is doing, and he will show him greater works&nbsp;than these so that you will be amazed.”</em> (John 5:20)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As Jesus walked about, he paid attention to the people along his path actively looking for opportunities to reveal God’s love and salvation. What was revealed, whether the effect of sin, hunger, physical disability, inner brokenness, or death, Jesus healed.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Believer, you are in Christ and Christ’s Spirit indwells you. He is always at work and wants people to encounter Him through your partnership (Matthew 28:18-20, John 15:5). </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ask the Lord to heal your spiritual eyes and ears to respond to people in your life as if He were you. You have been invited to partner with God in sharing and demonstrating the gospel!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Pray when you enter a room. Ask the Lord what He is doing and how you can practically join Him in revealing His love and redemption.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Do you lean toward the truth that Jesus wants to work through you or shy away from such a thought? What do you think is most honoring to Jesus?</p></li></ol><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father God, thank You for redeeming me. I ask for grace to see with spiritual eyes and listen with spiritual ears. I want to partner with Your Holy Spirit. May I live to honor and glorify You. In Jesus’ powerful name, I pray. Amen.</p>

      <title>Born Again</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2024/7/2/born-again</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Jesus replied,&nbsp;‘Truly I tell you, unless someone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.’”</em> (John 3:3)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Combine your favorite spiritual teacher and Supreme Court Justice. Now your imagination is on track to consider Nicodemus <em>the</em> expert Torah teacher of his time (John 3:1). </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With sincere spiritual hunger Nicodemus lived an exemplary life and became highly influential. He thought he had eternal life in the bag until the One who inspired scripture turned his theology upside down. Like many people Nicodemus assumed eternal salvation depended on him. He was wrong. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Salvation is a gift we receive. When we move from knowing about Jesus to trusting in Him rather than in ourselves, we are saved. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“For you are saved by grace&nbsp;through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God’s gift—not from works, so that no one can boast.”</em> (Ephesians 2:8-9)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus lovingly taught Nicodemus,&nbsp;<em>“Truly I tell you, unless someone is born&nbsp;of water and the Spirit,&nbsp;he cannot enter the kingdom of God.&nbsp;Whatever is born of the flesh&nbsp;is flesh, and whatever is born of the Spirit&nbsp;is spirit.”</em> (John 3:5-6)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Father sends His Holy Spirit to indwell those who place their faith in Christ. As we were born of our physical parents, we are now born of God, Who is Spirit. We are God’s children, born of His Spirit; born again. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With the presence and power of the Holy Spirit in your heart, you begin a new life. A full life transformed from the inside out. You are free from the dominating power of sin and empowered to become like Jesus. In Christ, you are a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You have been <em>“born again to a living hope.”</em> (1 Peter 1:3) Today spend time with your friend Jesus in scripture trusting His Spirit to shape you. His Spirit will increase His nature within you. What plans He must have in store for you, beloved child of God!</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Do you daily recognize your need for Christ? Ask God to form more of Jesus’ nature in you today.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What is the difference between believing in Jesus and being born again?</p></li></ol><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, I have placed my confidence in Jesus Christ as my Savior. I recognize my need for Your Holy Spirit and embrace His transformative power. Please help me to become like Jesus in increasing measure to Your glory, Father. Amen.</p>

      <title>Thirsty</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2024/7/31/thirsty</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Scripture</strong></span><strong>:</strong></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Let the one who is thirsty come. Let the one who desires take the water of life freely.”</em> (Revelation 22:17)</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Reading</strong></span><strong>:</strong></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the 100 degree heat, my daughter was headed to soccer practice with what felt like a miniature bottle of water. Worried about her, I did what every good mother does. I fussed.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Don’t worry, Mom. There’s a refill station.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Assured that she would not faint from thirst, I sent her off with that little bottle. How simple it was for her to believe that if she came to the provided source, she would have an unending supply. This is also true for those who believe and come to Christ for His Living Water, His Spirit.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Thirsting throughout the Bible is a picture of our need to be in relationship with God. He placed eternity - a spiritual craving - in every person’s heart so that we would seek to know Him (Ecclesiastes 3:11). God has also promised to quench this thirst if we come to Him (Isaiah 12:2-3; 44:3).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In John 7:37-39 we find Jesus at the Temple on the greatest day of the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles. On this day the priest would pour water on the altar calling to mind when God provided water in the desert (Exodus 17). This tradition represented the spiritual thirst for the fulfillment of God’s promise to pour out His Holy Spirit (Isaiah 12:1-3).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“On the last and most important day of the festival,&nbsp;Jesus stood up and cried out,&nbsp;‘If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink. The one who believes in me,&nbsp;as the Scripture&nbsp;has said, will have streams of living water&nbsp;flow&nbsp;from deep within him.’”</em>&nbsp;(John 7:37-38) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus told the crowds early in his ministry those who hunger and thirst for righteousness will be filled (Matthew 5:6). He told the woman at the well that the spiritual water He has for those who come to Him and believe <em>“…will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.”</em> (John 4:14) Jesus guides all who come to Him and believe in Him to the waters of life (Revelation 7:17).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Do you hunger and thirst? Jesus continues to speak ‘come to me,’ not just ‘believe in me.’ In your mind and with your heart, come to Jesus again. Welcome His Presence. Christ promises to satisfy your thirst with His Living Water through the power of His Holy Spirit. </p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Your Turn:</strong></span></h2><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In what ways do you thirst? How do you seek satisfaction? Ask Jesus for His Living Water.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How might the Lord be trying to overflow to others through you?</p></li></ol><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Prayer</strong></span><strong>:</strong></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You for drawing me to Christ. I come freely and ask for Your Water of Life. Holy Spirit, flow through me to others for Your glory and our blessing. Amen.</p>

      <title>Purposed</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2024/8/15/purposed</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Scripture</strong></span><strong>:</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“This came about so that God’s works&nbsp;might be displayed in him.”</em> (John 9:3)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Reading</strong></span><strong>:</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have vivid memories of sailing with my parents in choppy waters. My dad yelling, “Coming about,” and being walloped by the metal arm of a swinging sail. Sometimes hard things simply come about due to no fault of our own.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Like the blind beggar in John 9 you may have been born with an exceptional challenge or perhaps one has come about. Sin is often at the root of our challenges, but in this man’s case, Jesus made it clear that his blindness was divinely purposed (John 9:3).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“After he said these things he spit on the ground, made some mud&nbsp;from the saliva, and spread the mud on his eyes.&nbsp;‘Go,’&nbsp;he told him,&nbsp;‘wash in the pool of Siloam’&nbsp;(which means “Sent”). So he left, washed, and came back seeing.”</em> (John 9:6-7)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Nothing is above Christ’s purpose and ability to transform. Spit and mud became a healing balm. Darkness became light. A blind beggar became an eternal witness encouraging spiritual sight for endless generations.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christ desires to reveal Himself in our trials as well (Psalm 22:30). Yet without welcoming Jesus into our darkness, we are refusing what God wants to provide. We may think we see Him, but the reality is we are still spiritually blind.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the case of this beggar, it was the religious leaders who opposed Jesus’ work. Infuriated, they threw out the man who without wavering magnified Jesus as the Savior.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This side of eternity pain will come about, but then again so does Jesus to all who welcome Him. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>“</em></strong><em>Jesus heard that they had thrown the man out, and when he found him, he asked,&nbsp;‘Do you believe in the Son of Man?’”</em> (John 9:35) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Do you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ? If so, be confident that He has purposed good (Genesis 50:20, Romans 8:28). The Lord has found you and His work is coming about in you.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Your Turn</strong></span><strong>:</strong></h1><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Do you sense your own need for Jesus? Like this man what has come about in your life that only God can heal? Have you been thrown out in some way? Invite Jesus into your pain.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What was your life like when Jesus found you? How has He healed you? Take time to thank Him.</p></li></ol><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Prayer</strong></span><strong>:</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, in what ways am I spiritually blind? I want to see Your beauty. I welcome Your light into every area of my life. Thank You for Your healing. Reveal Yourself, Lord Jesus. Amen.</p>

      <title>Priorities</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Therefore, my dear friends,&nbsp;just as you have always obeyed,&nbsp;so now, not only in my presence but even more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.”</em> (Philippians 2:12)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">No one can develop your life as a Christian for you. Although Paul is speaking to a body of believers in Philippians 2:12, he is expecting each person to prioritize their relationship with God.  </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Paul writes in the very next verse, <em>“For it is God who is working in you both to will and to work according to his good purpose.”</em> (Philippians 2:13) Growing more sensitive to Christ in us to the point of obedience is the purpose of discipleship. It is why God is at work in you. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Trusting Christ for the gift of salvation is a glorious miracle, yet being a disciple of Jesus is another miraculous feat altogether, because it depends upon our participation. Discipleship is a lifelong experience with the empowerment and company of God to love and obey like Jesus.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christians do not work or earn salvation, but we intentionally choose to grow in our love, knowledge, and submission to God’s leadership <em>“walking in newness of life.” </em>(Romans 6:3-4) But Jesus encouraged his followers to count the cost of doing so (Luke 14:28).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Then he said to them all,&nbsp;“If anyone wants to follow after me, let him deny himself,&nbsp;take up his cross daily, and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life because of me will save it.” </em>(Luke 9:23-24)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Paul’s exhorts the Philippians <em>“who have always obeyed”</em> to <em>“work out your own salvation.”</em> He<em> </em>stresses their submitting to the Holy Spirit’s presence and authority within them. In doing likewise we too are empowered to live obediently in the light of our new identity, attentive to Christ’s guidance.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Are you daily prioritizing and following Christ? Allow your Heavenly Father to grow you into whom He created you to be. He is at work in you to will and work for His good purpose.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Working out your salvation is not the same thing as working for salvation. Having received the free gift of salvation, how is God calling you to prioritize your relationship with Him?</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How does living with an awareness of Christ at work in you compel you to live obediently?</p></li></ol><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You for what You have taught me about being Your child. I surrender to Your authority and ask You to reveal more of Yourself and Your ways to me. Empower me to love You, love people, and love life even more so. I pray this in Jesus’ name. Amen.</p>

      <title>Praise</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2024/9/12/praise</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Enter his gates with thanksgiving, and his courts with praise!”</em> (Psalm 100:4) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Rejoice in the&nbsp;Lord, you righteous ones; praise from the upright is beautiful.”</em> (Psalm 33:1)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Thanks, Mom! You’re the best!” My teenage daughter cheered as she entered my room.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I plopped down on the edge of my bed enjoying her enthusiasm. I had given her a simple gift, an expression of my compassion toward her. I had picked up her room. As we sat side by side, it was a delight to hear my name attached to her joy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Perhaps my full heart is a glimpse into how our Heavenly Father responds to our praise. Certainly, it is not a one-sided exchange. I imagine the Lord experiences something like you and I do when a loved one genuinely praises us. We are created in His image after all. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we are praised, it captures our attention, and our affection and joy swell. How much more so for God? And He is with us. As we give Him praise, it is as though His love and joy overflow into our souls.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The language of the King James Version reveals a beautiful insight about praising God<em>. “But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.”</em> (Psalm 22:3) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God dwells in the praises of His children. It reminds me of sitting in that space side by side with my daughter enjoying her company as she expressed gratitude and praise.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As praise fills the air, the Lord, who is love, leans in. In fact, He says He surrounds you with His faithful love. I imagine praise to be something like spiritual CPR, breathing in and out love.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“…the one who trusts in the&nbsp;Lord will have faithful love surrounding him. Be glad in the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;and rejoice, you righteous ones; shout for joy, all you upright in heart.”</em> (Psalm 32:10-11) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That bit of praise from my daughter ended with renewed connection and remembrance of how special we are to one another. Before she headed back to her corner of our home, we were both filled with joy. How much more so when we praise our Heavenly Father!</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn:</span></h1><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Read Psalm 100. Surrender again to Christ’s lordship and thank Him for being your good Shephard. Recognize that He is faithful love.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God is with you in your circumstances. His presence, plans, and promises are called to the forefront of your mind when you praise Him. How have you noticed His attributes in the past week, day, hour? Praise Him for these gifts.</p></li></ol><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lord Jesus, my heart rejoices in You because I trust who You are. You are so faithful in Your care for me. I praise You for Your goodness. I love You. Amen.</p>

      <title>Anointing</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2024/9/25/anointing</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span><em>:</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Now there are different gifts,&nbsp;but the same Spirit.&nbsp;There are different ministries, but the same Lord.&nbsp;And there are different activities, but the same God works all of them in each person.&nbsp;A manifestation of the Spirit is given to each person&nbsp;for the common good…”</em> (1 Corinthians 12:4-7)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“And they recognized that they had been with Jesus.” </em>(Acts 4:13)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">People recognized Peter and John as disciples who had been with Jesus. They were bold, ministering with faith, clearly anointed by God as they ministered in Jesus’ name. But this is not simply history, this is a glimpse of what is possible in a spiritual sense for all disciples of Christ. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Disciples are those who spend time with Jesus in scripture and prayer learning from Him, enjoying God with intention to do His will. Investing our time, we grow in friendship with the Lord increasingly aware of His anointing, the Holy Spirit’s presence within us (2 Peter 1:3; 1 John 2:27).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When you regularly spend time with God, serving through your gifting no longer feels like something you are doing in your own effort. There is a flow that is supernatural. You see the goodness the other person is experiencing and because it is a gift to you too, you experience a powerful joy and confidence in the Lord, and God is glorified.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you trust in Christ for your salvation and are taking the time to read this devotional let it assure you that you have the spiritual gifts of a new heart and the Holy Spirit. You are equipped and anointed. You have a specific spiritual ability through which the Holy Spirit will manifest to bless others.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Spend time with Jesus and then serve the body of Christ in His name. God will apply His Spirit to how you are wired and translate your effort into His expression. It is necessary. You are needed. God has a specific role for you in His story (Acts 13:36; 17:26).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>: </p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What are your strengths? Consider a time when you felt fully alive, fully satisfied using that strength. What were you doing?</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How can you apply this to serving others for His glory?</p></li></ol><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You for Your Holy Spirit. Please help me abide with Christ. I trust You will grow and mature me in my gifting as I take steps of faith. Show me how to serve You for Your glory. In Jesus’ name I pray. Amen.</p>

      <title>Prayer is Partnership</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Because of Christ and our faith in him, we can now come boldly and confidently into God’s presence.”</em> (Ephesians 3:12)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prayer is God’s idea. Truly, it is a brilliant gift that through Christ we have direct access to God through the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 2:18). </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Certainly, life will continue to move along if we do not pray, but we will miss much of the spiritual treasure and relationship Christ has given us. How often do we hear, <em>“You do not have, because you do not ask.” </em>(James 4:2)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We have the promises of God’s good gifts in our lives – His peace, provision, and protection to name a few. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Who among you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?&nbsp;Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?&nbsp;If you then, who are evil,&nbsp;know how to give good gifts to your children, how much will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him.”</em> (Matthew 7:9-11) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God is inviting you into partnership. Be His co-worker in prayer by bringing the details of your life into His shadow for safekeeping. Intercede on behalf of others. Come to Him with a willingness to be led by His Spirit. Pray for the impossible!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Through Christ you have direct access to God. Pray boldly and confidently knowing that <em>“all things are possible with God.”</em>&nbsp; (Matthew 19:26) In partnering with God through prayer the Lord will do more in you, for you, and through you than you could ever imagine.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. What is your greatest need? Set a daily reminder to pause and present your request to God this week.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. Choose a scripture from above. What does this verse mean to you? How does it apply to your life?</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Glory to you, God. By Your mighty work within me You are able to do far more than I would ever dare to ask or even dream of – infinitely beyond my highest prayers, desires, thoughts, or hopes. I bring you my request today. In Jesus’ powerful name I pray, amen. (Ephesians 3:20)</p>

      <title>Bold Faith</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2025/10/24/bold-faith</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated, common men, they were astonished. And they recognized that they had been with Jesus.”</em> (Acts 4:13)</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Peter and John were fishermen. Imagine them as little boys, knee-high to their fathers, pretending to tie knots onto fishing lines. Or as skinny preteens, all knees and elbows, struggling to keep their balance while heaving heavy nets overboard. Fishing on the Sea of Galilee was a part of their daily lives and became second nature to them.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But God gives His children something better than a second nature. He gives all who place their lives in His hands a new nature (Ephesians 4:24, 2 Corinthians 5:17). When we are born again, Christ begins shaping us little by little as we grow and learn at His side.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“While walking by&nbsp;the Sea of Galilee, [Jesus] saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.&nbsp;And he said to them,&nbsp;‘Follow me, and I will make you&nbsp;fishers of men.’ Immediately they left their nets and followed him.&nbsp;And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them.&nbsp;Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.”</em> (Matthew 4:18-22)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Peter and John knew the rhythm of casting and pulling, trusting the weight of the net and the lead sinkers to do their work. But Jesus called them away from the ordinary. He invited them to a new way of life; to fish for people, drawing others into the reality of God's kingdom.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That same invitation is ours. Not just to follow His teachings, but to accompany Jesus, letting His Spirit guide us. God's heart is for every one of His children to grasp the message and activity of God’s Kingdom. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Like Peter and John, the only way to overcome timidity and to experience freedom from the ordinary is to be with Jesus. As you spend time with Christ in His Word and prayer, trust the Holy Spirit to teach you what to do and give you the boldness to do it - as if it were second nature. God delights in granting common people uncommon boldness to His glory. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”</em> (1 Corinthians 1:26-31)</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. What does it mean to you that Peter and John are described as “ordinary men” in Acts 4:13? How does that encourage you in your own walk with Jesus?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. If someone observed your life, would they be able to tell that you have been with Jesus? What might that look like in your words, actions, or attitude?</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, I am so grateful to be Your child through faith in Jesus Christ. Please call me out of the ordinary and grace me with uncommon boldness to envelop people in the reality of Your Kingdom. Amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“When the vessels were full, she said to her son, ‘Bring me another vessel.’ And he said to her, ‘There is not another.’ Then the oil stopped flowing.”</em>&nbsp;(2 Kings 4:6)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have you ever found yourself in an impossible situation you did not cause? Perhaps unjust circumstances? </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In 2 Kings 4:1-7, we meet a widow who knew that kind of desperation. Her husband had died leaving her with debt she could not repay. This woman was facing poverty and likely the loss of her two sons as payment to a creditor.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This harsh reality was the result of a broken society. The kings had failed their sacred responsibilities, and the people were far from God. Moral callousness and destructive practices were the norm.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But even in a corrupt society, God saw the widow. He sent His servant Elisha to intervene. And with the kind of energy desperation creates, she cried to Elisha for help. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Elisha was a spiritual leader who had concern for individuals and ministered to families (1 Kings 17:8-24). Yet, He did not pay her debts. He also did not shame her for her need. Rather, he pointed out what she did have.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Elisha directed her to privately take steps of faith with what she had in her home - a common jar of oil.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As the woman obeyed in faith, she gathered as many empty vessels as she could find. Then, behind closed doors she began to pour. To the family’s amazement the jar poured out continually, filling every empty vessel they made available.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What a picture of God’s heart toward His people!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Like the widow’s empty vessels, our <em>“jars of clay”</em> were made to be filled with God’s oil (2 Corinthians 4:7). The presence and power of His very Spirit poured into willing and open lives.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But there is a catch. God considers our capacity. We must be empty of our own self-preservation, trying to patch our cracks, maintaining a tight lid on what we think we control.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The miracle begins when our own self-sufficiency ends. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Remember, <em>“The LORD will withhold no good thing from those who do what is right.”</em> (Psalm 84:11 NLT)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The same God who filled jars in a widow’s kitchen, still fills hearts today. There is no life too empty, no situation too far gone, no injustice too heavy that He cannot redeem. Continue to gather your vessels – your heart, your hopes, your life, and place them before the One whose oil never stops flowing.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What “jar of oil” do you have? Ask the Lord to guide you in pouring out your resources, gifts, and abilities that He might use them to bring provision or breakthrough.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What “empty vessels” in your life could God be inviting you to present to Him to be filled with His presence and power? (Your heart, relationships, dreams, circumstances…)</p></li></ol><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, You are the God of my salvation, my Provider, and Source of my joy. Thank you for listening to me. I present my heart and life circumstances to You. I need You. Please guide me into obedience and fill me afresh with Your Holy Spirit. It is in Jesus’ name, I pray. Amen.</p>

      <title>Created with Purpose</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2025/11/20/created-with-purpose</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“So I run with purpose in every step…”</em> (1 Corinthians 9:26 NLT)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As my elementary students passed around seashells the other day, our science lesson took an unexpected turn. This is one of the gifts of teaching at a Christian school. Those holy interruptions where creation points straight to the Creator. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We were talking about how God designed shells for a specific purpose. As I watched little hands turn those shells over, I could not help but point out that If God is that intentional about mollusks, how much more intentional is He with people He formed in His image?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Granted, it is a big leap from shellfish to children, but it gave me the perfect moment to share one of my favorite reminders of who we are in Christ.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Paul wrote, <em>“For&nbsp;we are his workmanship,&nbsp;created in Christ Jesus&nbsp;for good works,&nbsp;which God prepared beforehand,&nbsp;that we should walk in them.” </em>(Ephesians 2:10)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Each one of us is uniquely created to bring about God’s goodness to our generation. Every student in that room, every person trying to find their way, we are intended for divine purpose.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well.”</em> (Psalm 139:14)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God has woven His purpose into your very being. And the beauty is, you may have no idea how He plans to use you. If a shell could think, it certainly could not have imagined that one day it would help reveal God’s heart to fifty children, but God knew. In the same way, we often walk into assignments unaware of how He will use our presence, our gifts, our simple obedience. But He knows. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You are here, right now, in this exact place by His design.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“…</em> [God] <em>having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place, that they should seek God…”</em> (Acts 17:26-27). </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Today, rest in the truth that you were created by divine Love to reveal divine love (1 John 4:19). Invite the Holy Spirit to make you aware of the moments He designed for you. Pay attention to the gentle nudges. You never know what simple thing God might use to draw someone’s heart toward Him.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Where have you seen God’s intentional design in your life recently, even in small moments, like a seashell in a classroom?</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How can you run with purpose today, knowing that God has intentionally crafted you for a specific role in His plan?</p></li></ol><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>: </h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, I love You. Thank You that You have given me divine purpose in Your Son Jesus. Holy Spirit, please guide me into moments designed to reveal how good and loving You are! Amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a&nbsp;foundation, and&nbsp;someone else is building upon it. Let each one take care how he builds upon it. For no one can lay a&nbsp;foundation other&nbsp;than that which is laid,&nbsp;which is Jesus Christ.”</em> (1 Corinthians 3:10-11)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“The Spirit of the Lord&nbsp;God&nbsp;is upon me,&nbsp;because the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;has&nbsp;anointed me to bring good news to the poor, he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and&nbsp;the opening of the prison to those who are bound, to proclaim the year of the&nbsp;Lord's favor,&nbsp;and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn; to grant to those who mourn in Zion— to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit…” </em>(Isaiah 61:1-3)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Seven centuries after Isaiah penned this prophecy, Jesus sat in the synagogue of his hometown, opened the scroll of Isaiah, and declared these very words were being fulfilled in Him.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“<em>Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing,”</em> Jesus said. (Luke 4:21 </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God in flesh announced the good news of His will and power to heal, to free, to comfort, and to restore people to Himself. The same Jesus who spoke those words continues to transform lives today.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Do you believe the gospel? Have you experienced His healing, His freedom, and His blessing? Do you know His comfort, His transformation, and His joy? </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If so, God’s Word gives you a name.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“…that they may be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the&nbsp;Lord,&nbsp;that he may be glorified.”</em> (Isaiah 61:3)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Oaks of righteousness don’t just stand tall, they grow deep and strong, providing stability and shelter in the places where God has planted them. And do you know what they do?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“They shall build up the ancient ruins; they shall raise up the former devastations; they shall repair the ruined cities, the devastations of many generations.”</em> (Isaiah 61:4)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In Christ, you are an ambassador of the Lord, intended to be a restorer of what spiritual darkness has broken. Through the Holy Spirit, God invites you to co-labor in His ongoing work of reconciliation and restoration, hope and healing where you are positioned.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Over twenty centuries have passed since Jesus first read those words in Nazareth, yet His mission continues today through His people – through you. Invite the Lord to anoint you anew to use you as His planting right where you are. May your life bear the fruit of Christ’s ministry, glorifying your Father in Heaven.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“It is to my Father’s glory that you bear much fruit.”</em> <em>(John 15:8)</em></p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. If you yearn for the Lord’s help, comfort, and salvation, tell Him now. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. Ask Holy Spirit to show you how to be His hands and feet in building up, raising up, repairing your city, healing generations for His glory.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father God, Your Word says the kingdoms of this earth will pass away. Jesus Christ will reign. Lord, help me to bring the good news and fulfill Your work where I live. Awaken me to reconcile souls to You. May You alone be glorified. Amen.</p>

      <title>God's Protective Authority</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2025/2/13/gods-protective-authority</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture:</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Therefore, submit to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.” (James 4:7-8)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reading:</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sin is something like spiritual trash. Unattended it attracts flies. This is also true spiritually. Our rebellion creates an opening for negative spiritual influences. In fact, James tells us that sin “brings forth death.” (James 1:15)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we intentionally and daily place ourselves under God’s authority, we live according to His divine viewpoint rather than our own. Then, the abundant life that Jesus promises increasingly becomes our experience (John 10:10). It is life lived through a deep and meaningful relationship with God.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Before James tells his readers to “submit to God,” he points out how these Christians were living self-reliant lives. Enticed by selfish desires they were easily deceived and experiencing turmoil. To a degree, they had stopped drawing near to God, loving Jesus, obeying Him, and their lives showed it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We must be deliberate in what we resist and what we draw near. If we do not draw near to God, we either go with the flow or resist Him, and ultimately attract darkness. We want to live under the authority of the author of life, not death.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How are we to respond when we realize we have welcomed spiritual darkness?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We must repent of pride and confess our need for God’s authority. If not we may become “stiff necked” refusing to look to God, defensive, and self-centered. From there our spiritual enemy will continue to feed our sense of entitlement and wreak havoc in our lives.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ask the Holy Spirit to reveal if you are living outside of God’s protective authority. Make up your mind to submit daily to Him with your whole being. Place yourself under the Lord’s care through repentance and obedience.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For it is Your God who promises, “Therefore let us [with privilege] approach the throne of grace [that is, the throne of God’s gracious favor] with confidence and without fear, so that we may receive mercy [for our failures] and find [His amazing] grace to help in time of need [an appropriate blessing, coming just at the right moment].” (Hebrews 4:16AMP)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Your Turn:</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. Are there habits or actions that you need to bring into agreement with God? Ask the Lord to purify your heart and mind.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. How can you draw nearer to God and resist temptation?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer:</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father God, in Jesus name I bring myself and my family into the shelter of the Most High where we find rest in the shadow of the Almighty. I confess You are my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust. Lord, I submit to Your authority over my life. Thank You for drawing near to me. Amen. (Psalm 91)</p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">​​<strong>Scripture</strong>:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Therefore, take up the full armor of God, that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm.” </em>(Ephesians 6:13)<br><br><strong>Reading</strong>:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Do you picture Jesus as a warrior? Thanks to the illustrators of a childhood book, I grew up envisioning Jesus gently holding the faces of smiling children.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I doubt ancient Jewish children imagined the Messiah this way at all. In fact, the Old Testament makes it clear that their image was that of a warrior (Isaiah 11:4-5, 59:17, 63:1).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When Paul tells us, <em>“Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes,” </em>(Ephesians 6:11) he is teaching us to be like Christ, who was a warrior, engaged against a cunning spiritual enemy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.” </em>(Romans 13:12)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We are instructed to put on the Lord’s armor of light, an armor made of faith and love and hope. These are the essential traits of Christ’s as we step into our daily battles. This armor is practical and effective, rooted in an awareness that we are in a profound love story set in the midst of an epic war.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.” </em>(1 Thessalonians 5:8)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Because Satan has no power over the Lord (John 14:30), we intentionally come under the authority of Christ, or put on His armor, where the evil one cannot touch us.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the One who was born of God keeps them safe, and the evil one cannot harm them.” </em>(1 John 5:18)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ephesians 6:14-15 reveals that Christ has already covered you in elements of His armor when you placed your trust in Him. Now, it is your responsibility to accept His strength, stand firm, and pray. The One who holds your face has won the war.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Your Turn</strong>:<br>1. If passivity is in opposition to what God asks of His children, what part of Ephesians 6:10-20 can you</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">act on today? Resist temptation? Stand firm in God’s truth? Pray drawing from the Lord’s strength?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. Prayer is the weapon that grants us intimate contact with God whose Spirit activates and strengthens each piece, allowing us to stand strong in faith. Surrender yourself to a time in prayer.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Pray</strong>:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Thank You, Heavenly Father, that You have not left me defenseless as I face the battles of life. As I pray, guide me through the principles of the Lord’s armor that I may stand strong in His strength. Thank You for equipping me for victory. In my Savior’s mighty name, I pray. Amen.</p>

      <title>The Door of Life</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2025/3/20/the-door-of-life</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.” </em>(John 10:9-10) </p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have you ever had to explain how to use a door? It sounds strange, right? Doors are typically self-explanatory. They serve a clear and obvious purpose - leaving and entering. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is a door that beckons all to leave more than just a space. There is a door that leads to a more profound relationship than any other. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Twice in the Gospel of John Jesus said, <em>“I am the door.”</em> (John 10:7-10) </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With that simple illustration Jesus invites us into something life changing. What is it that Jesus calls every person to leave? Perhaps it is not simply a way out, but a way in. His life is the way in to living the fullest life possible, a life lived interacting with God. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Come near to God and he will come near to you.” </em>(James 4:8)<strong><em> </em></strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We all have stories of leaving and entering spaces and seasons. Maybe you have a story of leaving a life lived without God and being born again into life with Him. Have you ever considered Jesus has a personal testimony about you too? What is your story from His loving perspective? </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Whatever those details may be, Jesus knows every moment that has led you to where you are. He is the One who drew you to Himself (John 6:44). He has removed your sin as far as the east is from the west and you are safe in Him (Psalm 103:12, John 10:9). </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Psalm 103:2-5 paints a beautiful picture of what this looks like. <em>“Praise the Lord, my soul, and forget not all his benefits— who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion, who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.”</em>  </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As you walk through the doors that life presents to you, remember the door that Jesus is—the one that leads you straight into His love and an abundant life. </p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>: </h2><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What has Jesus Christ brought you out of? What has He brought you into? Look for evidence of His compassion and freedom.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How does John 10:9-10 apply to your story? Thank Jesus for life in Him.</p></li></ol><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:  </h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You for sending Your Son, Jesus, who is the door through which I enter into eternal life and a relationship with You. Guard me from the schemes of the enemy and guide me always on the path of righteousness into abundant life for Your name's sake. Amen. </p>

      <title>The Bread of Life</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2025/3/6/the-bread-of-life</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Jesus said to them, ‘I assure you: Moses didn't give you the bread from heaven, but My Father gives you the real bread from heaven. For the bread of God is the One who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.’”</em> (John 6:32-33)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We are experts in stuffing ourselves. Favorite foods satisfy our bodies. Media satiates our souls. News stimulates our minds. The illustrations are endless. But these fillers are often a brief attempt to distract ourselves from spiritual hunger. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“’I am&nbsp;the bread of life,’&nbsp;Jesus told them.&nbsp;‘No one who comes to me&nbsp;will ever be hungry,&nbsp;and no one who believes in me&nbsp;will ever be thirsty&nbsp;again.’”</em> (John 6:35)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus was speaking to a crowd who had seen His divine power. He had miraculously multiplied a small boy’s even smaller lunch to feed five thousand men and their families.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The crowd recognized this miracle as a sign of the Messiah, a second Moses of sorts, and hoped to make Jesus king. They were hungry for another miracle, something immediately satisfying. Yet Jesus shifted their focus to what is eternal.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“’Truly I tell you, anyone who believes&nbsp;has eternal life. I am the bread of life. Your ancestors ate the manna&nbsp;in the wilderness,&nbsp;and they died. This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that anyone may eat of it and not die.</em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread he will live&nbsp;forever.&nbsp;The bread that I will give for the life&nbsp;of the world is my flesh.’” </em>(John 6:47-51)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The living bread is not the same manna the crowd’s ancestors ate in the wilderness, but something greater! Jesus is the Messiah, the Savior of the world who gives eternal life. He gives Himself.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As eternal spiritual beings, we need His salvation as well as His spiritual nourishment. Like a branch grafted to a vine, we are to daily draw from Christ. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The bread of this world is full of fillers that in the end leave us feeling empty. Jesus is the Source and Sustainer of life. Jesus is the miracle! Bring your hungry heart to Him and be satisfied by the living bread.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. Do you hunger for more of Jesus? Tell Him. Voice your trust that He is faithful to fill your inner hunger.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. Ask Jesus for grace to bypass the bread of this world and teach you how to nourish yourself in His Presence through scripture, prayer, and other sacred practices.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, only You are able to take care of all my needs, physical and spiritual. Thank You for the many ways You have fed me. I confess that I tend to settle for less than what Jesus has for me. Please show me how to nourish myself in Christ Jesus, the Bread of Life. Amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“’Remain in me, and I will remain in you. For a branch cannot produce fruit if it is severed from the vine, and you cannot be fruitful unless you remain in me.</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>Yes, I am the vine; you are the branches. Those who remain in me, and I in them, will produce much fruit. For apart from me you can do nothing.’”</em> (John 15:4-5)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Imagine you are on a peaceful walk through your favorite outdoor spot. The air is fresh, the scenery is breathtaking, and you feel completely at ease. As you walk, you notice you are in perfect step with someone beside you — Jesus. You have been talking and listening, enjoying His company. In a warm, steady voice, He says to you, <em>“Apart from me you can do nothing.” </em>(John 15:5)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What is your reaction?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We may hear these words as a warning, perhaps even a threat. But considering the nature of Christ — full of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22) — perhaps these words are better understood as a blessing.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Just as a branch severed from a vine cannot bear fruit, we cannot glorify God when our hearts are far from Jesus<strong>.</strong> And that, friends, is actually the most freeing truth we can hear! When our hearts are close to Christ, we bear fruit that resembles Jesus as if He were living our lives. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus said, <em>“When you produce much fruit, you are my true disciples. This brings great glory to my Father.”</em> (John 15:8)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So, what does it mean to be a true disciple? At that time, it was said disciples walked so close to their teacher that they were covered in the dust their rabbi kicked up. Keep in mind, Jesus had many followers, but His true disciples were deeply connected to Him, devoting their lives to learning from His every action.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus, the true vine, is our source. What an encouragement this is: We do not have to do this on our own! As you remember Christ’s presence — drawing close to Him, seeking His guidance, and obeying His Word — He will honor you. He will transform you into a true disciple and do what you could never do on your own. He will glorify God, making an eternal impact through you.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. Is there a command of Jesus’ you know you need to obey? Ask God for grace and take a step in that direction.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. Throughout your day recalibrate yourself toward Jesus, perhaps at the beginning of a task or before you enter a room. Devote yourself to Him and ask for His guidance.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lord Jesus, You are the vine, and I am a branch. I trust You and ask for grace to abide in Your love, obeying You. Teach me how to be a true disciple. Bear much fruit through my life revealing God to those around me. I ask this for Your glory, Lord. I love You back. Amen.</p>

      <title>The Resurrection and the Life</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2025/4/28/the-resurrection-and-the-life</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>“</em></strong><em>Jesus said to her,&nbsp;‘I am&nbsp;the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me,&nbsp;even if he dies, will live.&nbsp;Everyone who lives and believes in me will never die.&nbsp;Do you believe this?’”</em> (John 11:25-26)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is a special woman mentioned three times in the gospel accounts. At every mention of this woman, she appears at the feet of Jesus (Luke 10:39, John 11:32; 12:3). Her name is Mary of Bethany. Whether Mary is listening, grieving, or worshiping, she is always near Christ. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In John 11, Lazarus, who is Mary’s brother and a close friend of Jesus, is battling for his life. Mary sent word to Jesus, trusting that He would save her brother. He healed everyone who sought Him! But to her utter heartbreak, Jesus did not come.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lazarus was buried in his tomb. Four days later Mary learned that Jesus had finally arrived on the scene. She came to Him, fell at His feet, and poured out her heart, affirming what she believed<em>. "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."</em> (John 11:32) In her grief, she still clung to the truth - Jesus is life.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Yet, Mary and Lazarus’ story did not end with this pain. Jesus allowed their profound suffering&nbsp;<em>“for the glory of God,&nbsp;so that the Son of God&nbsp;may be glorified through it.”</em> (John 11:4) Just as Lazarus' story did not end in the tomb, our painful situations can also experience new life.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christ’s resurrection power is available not only as a future hope but also a present reality. As we invite Jesus into our circumstances, trusting His transformative power, we can be near to Him in prayer and wait with His empowerment. This changes everything!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Paul reminded the believers in Rome of this powerful truth.<em> “We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may walk in newness of life.” </em>(Romans 6:4)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The same Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead now lives in you (Romans 8:11). His resurrection power is not just available - it is active. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As you consider Mary at the feet of Jesus - wondering, weeping, worshiping - may her example lead you to that same place of surrender and trust. He is the resurrection and the life. You are united to the One who conquered death and now offers His resurrection life to you. Keep coming to Jesus, again and again, where grace flows freely, and life begins anew.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. Like Mary, am I consistently positioning myself at the feet of Jesus regardless of my circumstances?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. What areas of life feel broken or burdensome? Ask Jesus to bring His resurrection power into those places.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lord Jesus, thank You that You are the resurrection and the life. There is no other like You! Thank You that You come to me and help me when I ask. You are so faithful. Please glorify Yourself through my circumstances. Amen.</p>

      <title>Hearing God</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2025/5/22/hearing-god</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me</em>.” (John 10:27)</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Between the wailing toddler and the chatting employees folding shirts, I heard my mom. It was a bustling weekend at Costco. Shopping carts maneuvered the tight lanes between the clothing tables. At the time, I was focused on the latest activewear, while Thin Mint Bites were calling my name.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Then I heard it. “Kristin.” My mom’s voice.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I could not see where she was, but the moment I heard her, my attention shifted. I did not need to see her to know it was my mom. She was somewhere in the distance. Her voice small and indistinct to my neighbors, but unmistakable to me. Why? Because I am her child.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I followed the impression the sound of her voice made, weaving through shoppers and squeezing past the sweater table until I saw her. She was standing still, her happy eyes fixed on me.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the same way, as God’s children, we recognize the voice of our Good Shepherd even in the middle of life’s noise. Not because it is the loudest, but because it is His voice. Concise. Kind. Personal. When we stop striving and start resting as His beloved, we begin to hear His still, small voice more clearly.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus said, <em>“My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.”</em> (John 10:27)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The moment we place our trust in Jesus for salvation, something beautiful happens. We become part of His family. He knows us, and we learn to know Him by the Word of God and the Spirit of God. His voice rises above the chaos, not through volume, but through relationship.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Remember Jesus also said, <em>“Everyone the Father gives me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will never cast out.” </em>(John 6:37)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you have come to Him by faith, you have entered into something more than belief. You have stepped into a living, loving, lasting relationship with the Son of God. And through this relationship, He has equipped you to hear His voice. Be aware of Him. He is your Good Shepherd, the One who laid down His life for you. Trust Him. Follow Him. He knows the way.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. What promises does Jesus make to His followers in John 10:27?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. It takes faith to follow the voice of God. Consider this verse. How does it encourage you to persevere with faith? <em>“Since, then, we have such a hope,&nbsp;we act with great boldness</em>.” (2 Corinthians 3:12)</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lord Jesus, I am so grateful that You are my Good Shepherd. I want Your voice to be the most recognizable voice to me – above all others. Please give me grace to listen and follow You in increasing measure. Amen.</p>

      <title>A Beautiful Thing</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2025/6/19/above-the-threat</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>: </h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Then Mary took a twelve-ounce jar of expensive perfume made from essence of nard, and she anointed Jesus’ feet with it, wiping his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance.”</em> (John 12:3 NLT)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>: </h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Imagine enjoying dinner, the room filled with friends, and the scent of food lingering in the air. The occasion? A meal in honor of Jesus, the One who just days before called Lazarus, who was dead and buried, back to life. The energy around the table is buzzing with gratitude, awe, and expectation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And then silence.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Perhaps it is the scent that catches your attention or maybe the soft sound of movement nearby. You glance up from your plate and see Mary, eyes brimming with tears, as she pours an expensive, fragrant perfume over Jesus’ feet. She kneels low, and with her own long hair, gently wipes them dry. This is not a moment of hospitality. It is worship. It is surrender. And it is deeply personal. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Lord tenderly received this moment from Mary. In fact, throughout the New Testament we see that Jesus received everything brought to Him that aligned with the heart of God. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Having encountered the love and power of Jesus, Mary gave to Jesus what cost her deeply - her treasure and reputation. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Meanwhile, the leaders who believed in Him remained silent. Their fear of rejection and hunger for approval kept them from stepping forward. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue; for they loved human praise more than praise from God.”</em> (John 12:42-43)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Friend, is there anything keeping you from fully pouring your life out at the feet of Jesus? Approval of others? Fear of being misunderstood? </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Because anything that keeps you from Him is bondage. And bondage never comes from God.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Allow your devotion to the Lord to come through. He will receive you, defend you, and honor you (John 12:7, Matthew 26:13). He may even call it beautiful.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Aware of this, Jesus said to them, “Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me.”</em> (Matthew 26:10)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>: </h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. Do you tend to hold back your devotion to Jesus because you fear being judged?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. Will your actions today be remembered as <em>“a beautiful thing”</em> done for Jesus? Ask the Holy Spirit to reveal how you can best worship Him today.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>: </h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lord Jesus, thank You for receiving me. I confess fear and valuing people’s opinions over our relationship. Help me to love You with my entire being - heart, soul, strength, and mind. Please show me how to give my best to You today. You are worth it all. Amen.</p>

      <title>Love Like Jesus</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2025/7/2/love-like-jesus</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”</em> (John 13:34–35)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A simple scroll through social media reveals a lot of what we love: our families, food, puppies, and vacations. Heart emojis and “#love” are everywhere online but meet someone face to face, who is hard to love, and suddenly our virtue can be rather lacking.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But Jesus was not vague. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">During one of His final conversations with the disciples before the cross, He reiterated the Old Testament command to <em>“…love your neighbor as yourself.”</em> (Leviticus 19:18) Yet the way He worded it was radical. <em>“A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you,…”</em> (John 13:34)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“As I have loved you,…”</em> Jesus had just washed their grungy feet. And let us not forget that Judas was still at the table when he said this. He knew Peter would deny Him within hours too. Yet, He still looked around at that broken group of men and said, <em>“By this…”</em> (John 13:35)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”</em> (John 13:35)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He did not mean that we are to love when it is convenient, nor when people earn it. He did not command to love only the people who agree with you, live like you, or speak kindly to you.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We are to simply love one another - selfless, sacrificial, servant-hearted love - like Jesus. This is the mark of a maturing Christian.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This kind of selfless love is hard. It means forgiving when it hurts. Listening without needing to be right. Showing up with the perspective of Christ when others (or you) fall short. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus said that everyone will know we are His disciples, not by our theology, our Instagram reels, or our opinions, but by how we love. That is our defining trait, the spiritual fingerprint of the Holy Spirit.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So today, maybe the most radical thing we can do is ask, “How can I love like Jesus right now?” It may look like giving someone your full attention, offering an apology, or taking the risk. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The world does not need more photographs and clever words about what we love. It needs living proof of Christ’s love in action. By this love, His love, Jesus has invited you to be that proof. </p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. In what way is Jesus’ command to love one another a new command? </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. What does a life defined by Christ-like love look like? Pray for a clear way to show love this week.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You for revealing true love, Your love through Jesus. Help me to die to my self-life and live to love others selflessly. Let Your love shine through me. Amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:  </h2><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>“Rest in God alone, my soul, for my hope comes from him.” </em>(Psalm 62:5 CSB)</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h2><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">I have lost count the number of times I have asked my kids to pick up their rooms. Have you been there too? We know that there is something to putting our stuff in its proper place that instantly brings peace. The same is true for thoughts that run amuck, tangling our emotions.</p><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">That is when you need to put your soul to rest, tucked safely into your Lord’s presence - its rightful place.</p><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">David reminded himself (and us), <em>“Rest in God alone, my soul, for my hope comes from him.” </em>(Psalm 62:5)</p><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">David wrote this while he and his exhausted people<em> </em>fled for their lives (see 2 Samuel 17:29). Instead of spiraling into anxiety, he chose to direct his mind and heart to rest in God, reliant on His faithful care.</p><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">Like a sword resting in its sheath, David placed his soul where it belonged. His hope was grounded on substantial evidence: the promises of scripture, the testimony of God’s people, and his own relationship with God. David knew and trusted God’s character.</p><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">You and I can do the same, even when relationships, responsibilities, and news headlines are chaotic. </p><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">God is faithful even when we are faithless (2 Timothy 2:13). That is who He is! The Lord will never abandon you nor forsake you. He is with you, and His desire is to do good for you (Jeremiah 29:11-13).</p><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">C.S. Lewis once wrote, “He who has God and everything else has no more than he who has God only.” </p><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">The Lord is breathing room for your soul. In quiet, allow God to furnish your expectations with His promises. Hope will come, and His hope will not disappoint (Romans 5:5).</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h2><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">1. When your soul is anxious, picture yourself like a child climbing into the arms of Jesus. He said, <em>“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.”</em> (Matthew 11:28)</p><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">2. Take intentional time to be still before God. Turn down the noise. Meditate on a promise like 1 Peter 5:7, <em>“Cast all your cares on Him, because He cares for you.”</em> Surrender your fears, your future, and your family into His faithful hands.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lord God, I come to You and want to rest in the assurance of Your promises, power, and presence. You are the Source of my hope. With thankfulness and expectation, I trust You. In Jesus’ name, I pray. Amen.</p>

      <title>The Perfect Parent</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are!”</em> (1 John 3:1)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I can still feel the gentle rocking, the warm weight of my little girl resting in my lap; the faint scent of baby shampoo. That evening, highlighted only by the hallway light, our speech delayed daughter began to sing with me - a song, a definite message, I had sung to her from her very beginning. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Jesus Loves Me.” </em>My words had become her own. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In that moment, I felt so much joy!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lest you think I’m tooting my own horn, I also recall hearing from another child in a heated discussion something much harder. Our teenager told me that when she thinks critical thoughts about herself, it’s my voice she hears.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In that moment, my heart cracked.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is only one perfect parent. The Bible shows that God lovingly, truthfully speaks with purpose. His words are never careless. He is our good Father who builds us up, corrects us with His love, and calls us to His will. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If it’s true that our parents’ voices significantly influence our inner voice, then it certainly would benefit us to know our perfect Heavenly Father’s voice. And as a child of God and by the power of His Spirit, we can also be His echo, speaking life-giving words to those around us, especially to our children.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Your Heavenly Father speaks over you, His child, with love and devotion. He assures you that His affection is not dependent on your performance (Zephaniah 3:17). His words guide you (Psalm 32:8). And like a present Father, He calls you back when you wander from what is best and lovingly corrects you (Proverbs 3:11–12). Your Heavenly Father’s voice always resonates with hope. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As you spend time in God’s Word, notice His voice in your thoughts: words of identity, love, delight, guidance, wisdom, instruction, encouragement, and hope. Yes, indeed Jesus loves you deeply. Choose to be His echo.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. In a world that uses all sorts of labels, knowing God calls you His “<em>chosen</em>” and “<em>beloved</em>,” how does that change the way you see yourself (1 Peter 2:9)? </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. How can you remind yourself that the Lord is <em>rejoicing</em> over you every day (Zph. 3:17)?</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lord God, You are so good! Thank You for speaking life over me. Please renew my mind and transform me to echo Your life-giving words, especially to my loved ones. Amen.</p>

      <title>Growing</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2025/8/28/growing</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Follow my example,&nbsp;as I follow the example of Christ.”</em> (1 Corinthians 11:1)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I first walked into an elementary school as a brand-new teacher I was absolutely clueless. I had graduated with honors, and I knew what good teaching could produce, but I had no idea how to actually get there. Thankfully, I was placed on a team with experienced teachers who took me in and showed me how it’s done.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That’s the story you’ll hear from most impactful teachers. The most valuable lessons didn’t come through theory and knowledge, but from mentorship, modeling, and life on life experience. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is exactly the way Jesus calls us to grow as His disciples.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus said, <em>“‘All authority&nbsp;in heaven and on earth has been given to me.&nbsp;Go therefore and&nbsp;make disciples of&nbsp;all nations,&nbsp;baptizing them&nbsp;in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>teaching them&nbsp;to observe all that&nbsp;I have commanded you. And behold,&nbsp;I am with you always, to&nbsp;the end of the age.’” </em>(Matthew 28:18-20)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus wasn’t giving his disciples a suggestion. He was giving them their mission. And it’s ours too. We are called to live under God’s authority, to follow the ways of His Kingdom, to immerse others into the reality of God, and to teach them how to do the same.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That’s a pretty heavy lift.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But here’s our hope – Jesus promised to always be with us. Through His Spirit He empowers us to live out what He has commanded. His Holy Spirit is our helper (John 16:7).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When you walk in obedience you open yourself to the flow of God’s grace. He renews your mind, restores your soul, revives your heart to bless you - and to empower you to disciple others. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Paul put it this way: <em>“He is the one we proclaim, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ.”</em> (Colossians 1:28)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is the way of apprenticeship. Life on life. It’s how Jesus lived with His followers. And it’s how we are called to live today. It’s an invitation to bring people close, to point them to Jesus, and to grow side by side into His likeness (1 Timothy 4:8).</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. Being a Christian is more than simply attending church. You are the church, the body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:27). How might God be inviting you build up and disciple others?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. Who has modeled the way of Jesus for you? How can you do the same for someone else?</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lord Jesus, thank You so much that You disciple me through Your Word, Your Spirit, and Your people. Help me to go and make disciples. Teach us to obey all you have commanded for Your glory and our blessing. Amen.</p>

      <title>Above the Threat</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2025/8/6/above-the-threat</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are protected.”</em> (Proverbs 18:10)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The sea spray stung my face, and the sunlight was blinding as I squealed with delight. My dad had just lifted me high above a crashing wave. In that moment, he was the center of everything. He was my protector, my safety, my joy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I did not know how my dad would do it, but I knew he would. As his daughter I trusted him – his strength, his love, his timing. I looked to him and in one smooth motion he raised me above the threat with perfect timing.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Just as my father stood like a strong tower and shielded me from a force too strong for me to withstand, God is our ever-present refuge. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“God is our refuge and strength, a helper who is always found in times of trouble.”</em> (Psalm 46:1)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As you seek refuge in God, centering your heart and life on Jesus, you are protected. You do this by relying upon His character and love for you even as you feel waves crashing around you. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Proverbs 18:10 says the righteous are “protected,” but in the original Hebrew, the word carries a deeper meaning. It means <em>exalted</em> – lifted up, set out of the reach of danger. It is not just about hiding; it is about being raised above the threat. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus was lifted up on a cross for you. And because of Him, you are lifted up too.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“He also raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavens in Christ Jesus…”</em> (Ephesians 2:6)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus knew the waves of torture, humiliation, and death were coming. He knew His closest friends would deceive, deny, and doubt Him. Yet, He trusted His Father. Jesus rested in His Father’s power, faithful love, and perfect timing to lift Him above His enemies. (John 13)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That same Father, your Heavenly Father, is lifting you too. Jesus has already taken the crushing wave. Now, you are secure in Him. Today may the Holy Spirit fill you with the joy of victory as you run to Him. Let your Heavenly Father lift you above fear, above uncertainty, above the threat.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. What feels threatening to you today? Run to the Lord in prayer. Ask Him to lift you above it to help you see from His perspective and to trust His perfect timing. (Ecclesiastes 3:1, 1 Timothy 6:15)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. How have you seen the Lord’s character and care for you in the past? Reflect on the ways He has protected and provided for you.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heavenly Father, thank You for lifting me above what is threatening. You are my helper, my strong tower, who is always found in times of trouble. Thank You, Jesus. Amen.</p>

      <title>Jesus at the Lunch Table</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2025/9/11/jesus-at-the-lunch-table</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Go therefore and&nbsp;make disciples of&nbsp;all nations,&nbsp;baptizing them&nbsp;in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,&nbsp;teaching them&nbsp;to observe all that&nbsp;I have commanded you. And behold,&nbsp;I am with you always, to&nbsp;the end of the age.”</em> (Matthew 28:19-20)</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“My friend asked Jesus into her heart today!” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I can still see my kindergartener with her Dora backpack parachuting over her shoulders. Climbing into our minivan one hot pink Converse at a time, she announced her news.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I told her about Jesus at lunch and asked if she wanted Jesus to live in her heart too.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They prayed with peanut butter jelly sandwiches in their hands.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For the life of me, I will never get over this. The ease. The simplicity. The pure-hearted wonder of it all.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But here’s the thing - it didn’t happen in a vacuum. She had been discipled.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus commands us to <em>“make disciples”</em> (Matthew 28:19). That word <em>cause</em> may be helpful when considering the Lord’s mandate to make disciples. The Greek word for <em>“make“ </em>carries with it the idea of helping others enter into the life of discipleship. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My daughter had not been trained to lead her friend to Christ. She was simply raised to know the love of Jesus, His Word woven through our everyday rhythm and community.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My daughter’s heart was in step with her knowledge of God.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That’s what the Holy Spirit does. Whether the ancient apostles or a modern kindergartener, as we spend time with Jesus in prayer and take in Scripture, He causes our heart knowledge to surpass our head knowledge (John 14:26, Ephesians 3:16-19). He empowers us with courage (2 Timothy 1:7), equips us with His Word (2 Timothy 3:16-17), and promises His presence always (Matthew 28:20).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Making disciples can feel overwhelming. But just as my daughter went with Jesus into her cafeteria, you too have Jesus in every ordinary place.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So, the question is how is God leading you? Who is at your table? Who are you walking beside, eating with, and listening to this week? Your obedience may cause another heart to say yes to Jesus.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Turn</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. When have you sensed God’s love surpassing your understanding, and how can you share that testimony to encourage someone else?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. Since Scripture equips us (2 Timothy 3:16-17), the Spirit strengthens us (Eph 3:16-19), and Jesus sends us (Matt 28:19-20), what would it look like for you to rely on all three as you live out your faith this week?</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prayer</span>:</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God, thank You for discipling me through Your Spirit, Your Word, Your people. Strengthen me to live and love in a way that reflects you. I pray for grace to teach others&nbsp;to obey all that&nbsp;You have commanded. Amen.</p>

      <title>A Song in the Night</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/2025/9/24/a-song-in-the-night</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Scripture</span></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“By day the Lord commands his steadfast love, and at night his song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life.” (Psalm 42:8)</em></p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reading</span></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I recently came across the lines of a deeply honest worship song. It was written by a worship leader who longed for God. His season of life felt pitch-black like midnight – a cloudy, starless midnight. There was no sign of the joy that once marked his life.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Rather than shouts of gladness and songs of praise, questions echoed through his mind, <em>“Why am I discouraged? Why is my heart so sad?”</em> (Psalm 42:5)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He vulnerably confessed the torment of a constant taunt in his thought life. <em>“Where is your God?”</em> (Psalm 42:10)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The weight of oppression and the turmoil within left him feeling forgotten, unseen, overwhelmed.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have you ever felt that way? Like breakers and waves of sorrow crash into your soul, only to retreat and creep in again with relentless rhythm. You are not the only one. Seasons of wrestling between faith and despair occur in every believer’s life.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">However, this songwriter, the author of Psalm 42, offers us a lifeline, not in the form of easy answers but in the form of remembrance.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The psalmist chooses to remember God. <em>“I will put my hope in God! I will praise him again – my Savior and my God!”</em>(Psalm 42:5 NLT)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Even when God seems hidden from your circumstances, scripture reminds us that your spirit is united to Him with Christ. <em>“But whoever is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit.”</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And even in the night He gives songs (Job 35:10).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Zephaniah 3:17 paints a beautiful picture of God’s presence, power, pleasure, and peace – His sacred song over you even in the dark: <em>“For the LORD your God is living among you. He is a mighty savior. He will take delight in you with gladness. With his love, he will calm all your fears. He will rejoice over you with joyful songs.”</em> (Zephaniah 3:17 NLT)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God is the Source of all life, and He sustains you in the dark. Where the enemy has carved emptiness into your soul, God fills it with His comfort and assurance – His song in the dark.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So today remember God’s Presence. Remember His mercy. Remember His loving kindness. Dare to believe God is rejoicing over you.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In faith, begin to sing back.

      <title>A Light Has Dawned</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/alighthasdawned</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Isaiah 9:2&nbsp; The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of deep darkness a light has dawned.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> As I read Isaiah 9, verse 2 captures my attention this Christmas season.&nbsp; Some of us are making preparations to celebrate Christmas, like putting up a Christmas tree, hanging lights and decorations, attending parties and festive gatherings, and shopping for gifts. However, there are other people who are grieving and struggling to find joy.&nbsp; The Christmas season can feel dark and lonely to many people, for many different reasons.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> I think of my dear friend, Wendy, who suddenly lost her husband, Gus, in November due to a sudden heart attack.&nbsp; Wendy and her 17 year old son are deeply grieving the loss of their husband and father as they experience their first Christmas without him.&nbsp; Gus was a man who loved Jesus and lived to serve God by doing good deeds for others.&nbsp; He was a self-employed carpenter (ironic, I know) who never turned a profit because he only charged his customers for exact amount of the materials he used and the bare minimum for his time.&nbsp; He would drop everything to go help an elderly woman with her septic system, or fix a leaky faucet, or gift a single mother of 3 with a car (seriously!), or adopt a dog that you could no l longer care for.&nbsp; His acts of kindness and generosity were limitless and always in the name of Jesus. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> As you might expect, Gus loved celebrating Christmas!&nbsp; He exuded joy and he always wore a Santa hat during December. He would even carry extra Santa hats to give to people.&nbsp; In fact, I just dug into my winter hat and glove bin the other day and there at the top of the bin were several Santa hats that Gus had given to me a few years earlier.&nbsp; The memory is bittersweet, but it makes me smile. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> Isaiah 9 fills me with hope as I think about the birth of Jesus and what His life and death means for His believers.&nbsp; But during this time of darkness for my friend Wendy, her son, and all the people who loved Gus, I lean into verse 2 for comfort that our Lord is with us even in times of pain and sorrow.&nbsp; Our Lord and Savior is the Light of the World, a light that we can cling to for comfort.&nbsp; Even when our hope is diminished, Jesus renews our hope and leads us through the darkness when we seek Him. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> Heavenly Father, Thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to live and die for us. Thank you, Jesus, for being our hope and our light when our days get dark and our burdens are heavy.&nbsp; Thank you for loving us and always meeting us exactly where we are in our joys or struggles.&nbsp; As we approach this holiday season, bring peace to our hearts and let us find comfort and healing in your joyous light.&nbsp; And thank you, Lord, for the life of Gus.&nbsp; There is no doubt in my mind that he is walking with you in Heaven wearing his Santa hat.&nbsp; Maybe he even has you wearing one, too?&nbsp; In your holy name, we pray.&nbsp; Amen!</p>

      <title>An Inside-Out Kind of Year</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/an-inside-out-kind-of-year</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“He who has found his life will lose it and he who has lost his life for My sake will find it.” Matthew 10:39 NASB</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Often, God uses a specific scripture verse to challenge me and set the tone for an upcoming season. The start of this year was no exception. I found myself reading Ecclesiastes chapter eleven over and over. Here we are reminded that if we don’t take steps of faith, we will be like a farmer who never sows any seeds but still expects a crop to spring up.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It was as if God was telling me - it’s time to move. It’s time to be bold. It’s time to make changes.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So far, so good.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Then I got to the last verse of the chapter, “Remove grief and anger from your heart and put away pain from your body, because childhood and the prime of life are fleeting.” (Ecclesiastes 11:10) Now it was as if God was shining a spotlight on my soul, showing me that if I wanted to walk by faith and make an impact in the world, I had a critical step to take - it was time to heal.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This began what I would call an inside-out kind of year. On the outside – life was fairly normal. Sure, it had highs and lows, but overall it was stable and even somewhat predictable. However, on the inside, I experienced dramatic change as I walked through a painful process of seeing the dark places of my heart.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If I’m honest, I’m not sad to say good-bye to 2019. The process of growth wasn’t easy. Many days I questioned God. <em>Why? What are you doing? When will this be over? What is the purpose of this?</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I don’t know what kind of year you’ve had, but chances are you can relate to experiencing pain and hurt. If we are not careful, we can carry the pain of the past into our future. We can allow doubt and fear to overshadow God’s promises.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As we look to 2020, God has given me a new verse to mark a new season. Jesus promised that “he who has lost his life for My sake will find it.” When we truly follow Jesus, we have to lose our own lives. Often this can feel like everything is in upheaval, it can be painful, and it is definitely not easy. But this inside-out, upside-down approach is the path that leads us to life.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you have experienced loss, confusion, or hurt in your pursuit of Jesus, be encouraged. This is not an indicator that you have done something wrong or that you have lost your way. In fact, it probably means that you are right on the path to finding true life.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I don’t know what 2020 has in store for you, but this I do know - God doesn’t waste our hurt, He doesn’t give up on us, and He can redeem even the most painful circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God, thank you that You have the power to make sense of the confusion and chaos of my soul.&nbsp; Help me see life from Your perspective. I want to pursue true life, even when I can’t see or understand the process. I choose to find hope in You. Amen.</p>

      <title>Don't Block The Light</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/dontblockthelight</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A few nights ago, I was reading a Berenstain Bears story with my 3-year-old son.&nbsp; We sat together on the bed, his eyes wide as we turned through the colorful pages. In the story that we were reading, Sister Bear was scared of “spooky shadows.”&nbsp; Trying to comfort his daughter, Papa Bear told her, “<em>Shadows happen when something blocks the light</em>."</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As I read these words out loud to my son…it struck me, right then. The shadows in our life...the darkness we feel in our hearts—comes when we allow things to block the light.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"God is light; in him there is no darkness at all." -1 John 1:5</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God is the LIGHT that fills our souls with joy and true peace. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Things like pride, lust, material things, unforgiveness, bitterness and our own evil desires can very easily block Him from fully changing our hearts. The shadows cast into our hearts as a result fill our hearts and our lives with darkness.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Romans 13:12 tells us, “lay aside&nbsp;the deeds of darkness and put on&nbsp;the armor of light.”&nbsp; For God’s light protects us, as strong armor protects a warrior on the battlefield.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Don't block His light. Open your heart to God fully and allow the Light in--and He will fill you with the <strong><em>joy</em></strong>&nbsp;and the <strong><em>peace</em></strong>&nbsp;that come from walking with Him as you LIVE as a Child of the Light.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“For&nbsp;you were formerly&nbsp;darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk as&nbsp;children of Light.”&nbsp; &nbsp; -Ephesians 5:8</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> Prayer:&nbsp; Heavenly Father, guard our hearts and minds, our very souls, against the darkness.&nbsp; Fill us with Your love and your LIGHT and help us to reflect Your light to others.&nbsp; Amen.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> </p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p>

      <title>You Asked for It</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/leadwell2022q4</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Lead Well Q4 2022</strong></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br>There was one question that I did not have time to cover in last night’s Lead Well teaching, but it’s a very important question for every leader:<br></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>How do you delegate well?</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The key to delegation is understanding what delegation is, and knowing the difference between delegation and abdication. Let’s define these two words.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Delegation - the process of entrusting and empowering</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Abdication - failure to fulfill a responsibility or duty</p></blockquote><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With delegation a process and a progression are involved. Think of good delegation happening in five stages.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>The Five Stages of Delegation</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>1. I do.</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You cannot lead where you have not been. Jesus has never asked us to do anything that he has not first done himself.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>2. I do, you watch.</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Invite another person or others into the process. Give the why and teach the how. Why is the most important question to answer, but how is a close second.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>3. We do together</strong>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s at this point that many of us abdicate because we’re relieved to have it off our plate, or because it feels inefficient, but this is the most critical step. Skipping this step means you haven’t delegated, you’ve dumped. That’s not responsible leadership. Give responsibility, be present, and follow up with evaluation and feedback.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What’s Right, Wrong, Confusing, Missing? Accentuate what’s right. Fix what’s wrong. Clarify what’s confusing. Add what’s missing.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>4. You do, I watch.</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You’re now hands off and observing. This step is followed by evaluation and feedback.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>5. You do.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You’ve followed the process and the progression, and while it may have felt inefficient, it will save so much time and confusion in the long run. The doing is still followed by evaluation and feedback. Jesus modeled this with the 72 in <strong>Luke 10:17-20: </strong></p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>17 The seventy-two returned with joy and said, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name.” 18 He replied, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. 19 I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you. 20 However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”</strong></p><p style="text-align:right;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><strong>Luke 10:17-20 NIV </strong></p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With you and for you, </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Pastor Gabe </p>

      <title>My Journey to Find my Identity in Christ</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/my-journey-to-find-my-identity-in-christ</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading:</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Matthew 7: 24-27</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it” (ESV)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I became a Christian at a very young age, I grew up in a Christian household, I went to vacation bible school, youth retreats, and even a Christian college. I have heard this passage many times in my life, even in song format. However, up until a few years ago, I never really allowed a core message of this passage influence the way I live out my everyday life: place your identity in Christ and let the truth of your redemption be the foundation that informs your decisions.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What I did instead was allow my identity to be governed by external things that are fleeting and change with the circumstances of life. Among my friend groups growing up, I was always the “smart one.” I soon came to not only embrace that label, but let it define me. This pattern can be seen most clearly when I look at my college years. I remember many weekends where I would prioritize studying or classwork over going to church. I let the fear of not performing well academically keep me from the best that God had to offer me. My error here did not end when I walked across the stage at graduation; it transitioned easily to the “real world.” Simply replace classrooms for office buildings and grades with performance reviews.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Eventually, I realized this pattern I had allowed myself to fall into. The amazing part is that the fix is simple, because God does the heavy lifting. All I had to do was come to Him with a repentant heart in earnest prayer. When we do this, we are simply allowing space for the Holy Spirit to work in our lives.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am still not perfect in this area, but I have seen a real tangible change in my life since I started actively trying to apply this principal. When I inevitably make a mistake a work, because I am human, it does not rock my world or ruin my whole day. Don’t get me wrong, I still try to do my best at whatever I work at, but I am now free from the burden of thinking I have to perform perfectly because I know that at the end of the day what really matters is embracing my spiritual identity and gifts and using them to help bring the kingdom of God here on earth.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Lord, help me to remember that my identity is not based in the fleeting things of this world; to remember that my identity is only truly fulfilled when I am working for your glory.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I came to know the Lord as an adult, and I happened to attend a church where praying out loud by individuals was part of every Sunday morning worship.&nbsp; To begin with I thought Christians had another language I was not aware of. &nbsp; I would listen as the people in this congregation would lift up beautiful prayers.&nbsp; I was mesmerized as the sweetest words would be spoken.&nbsp; I did not grow up in church or really ever hear much of any type of prayer being lifted.&nbsp; After hearing them I really felt like I could never utter any words out loud for others to hear.&nbsp; I felt my words would never be worthy in comparison.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After our first year at this church and our first year living for the Lord, a little boy in the church – maybe 6 years old was diagnosed with cancer.&nbsp; This was a smaller church maybe 250 people.&nbsp; One Sunday morning they brought this little boy up front to pray over him, many people got up to surround him physically and I felt the power of that prayer like nothing I had experienced before.&nbsp; The next visit to the doctors, the report was that he did not have one bit of cancer in his little body.&nbsp; My heart just beat for prayer from that moment on.&nbsp; It still took me a while longer to be able to utter prayer out loud.&nbsp; I began small, just a sentence, and that was for some reason excruciating.&nbsp; But I continued to be faithful and talk to God out loud among others.&nbsp; That is really all prayer is, talking to God and listening for His voice.&nbsp; As we obey God and open our hearts to Him, He will do in us what we cannot do – change our hearts. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We don’t need to have any “right, correct” words, we just need to have a heart to communicate with and hear from Him.&nbsp; He does not analyze our words or the way we say them, He only wants our hearts.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have you ever thought about the idea that when you pray aloud, you also allow others to have a connection with God in a way they perhaps would not have known? &nbsp; That perhaps you would be giving others confidence and examples to draw from?&nbsp; When we are with others who are praying, we are standing in agreement with them as they speak to the Lord.&nbsp; We are opening our hearts and asking our Lord to come in and abide in us.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When the Bible says “pray without ceasing” – the concept is not that we need to be praying words aloud all day, but that we say in a mindset of prayer.&nbsp; The more we practice this the more it becomes our heartbeat.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Lord is wanting to hear from us.&nbsp; What is your next step?&nbsp; Do you have a prayer time to be alone with God?&nbsp; Maybe your next step is to say a sentence prayer out loud at group or a gathering? Maybe it is time to join our prayer team.&nbsp; Wherever God nudges you, He desires for us to be in fellowship with Him and for us to live in freedom and abundance.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father, thank you for loving us so much that our fellowship with you is what you desire most.&nbsp; Give us opportunity to give you our heart and sit at your feet.&nbsp; We love you and praise you!&nbsp; Amen </p>

      <title>Residing Joy</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/residing-joy-adventdevo</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Residing Joy</h1><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“The angel reassured them. “Don’t be afraid!” he said. “I bring you good news that will bring great joy to all people. The Savior—yes, the Messiah, the Lord—has been born today in Bethlehem, the city of David! And you will recognize him by this sign: You will find a baby wrapped snugly in strips of cloth, lying in a manger.”&nbsp;</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Suddenly, the angel was joined by a vast host of others—the armies of heaven—praising God and saying, “Glory to God in the highest heaven, and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased.</em>” (Luke 2:10-14 NLT)</p></blockquote><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What news can bring great joy to all people?</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Only one announcement can bring exceedingly great joy to every person ever created regardless of culture and century.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">C.S. Lewis wrote,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The Son of God became a man to enable men to become sons of God.”</p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God sent His Son to reconcile all people to Himself. The eternal rift between souls and God, which cannot be restored from our side, was bridged by Christ. When we receive His rescue, the promises of God become our life’s foundation. We are released from the penalty of sinful choices. Our despair is revolutionized by hope. As His Spirit leads, we experience a residing joy and a sense of well being that is not dependent on circumstances. Being restored to God, we are given the Holy Spirit who is the source of this joy (see Galatians 5:22).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The announcement of Jesus’ birth led the angels to rejoice knowing what he would accomplish.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The people of this time knew too well the effect of rebellion against God. Not only were they living under political tyranny and oppression, but God had withdrawn His presence to honor His people’s repeated unbelief and the resulting idolatry. For approximately 400 years God held Himself back from His people until this undeserved moment when <em>“the Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.” </em>(John 1:14)&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For these first-century people the birth of Jesus was such brilliant news that the despair which taunts humankind was pushed back by exceedingly great joy - and will be forevermore.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">May this joy eclipse whatever attempts to overshadow your heart.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Angels and the radiance of God’s glory may not be manifesting in the sky over your head, but you have something better. You have Immanuel, God with you, and He is pleased with you!&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“The LORD your God is with you, the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you; in his love he will no longer rebuke you, but will rejoice over you with singing.” </em>(Zephaniah 3:17)</p></blockquote><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">PRAYER</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Father, thank You for sending Jesus to rescue me. You are the source and giver of all joy. Today I choose to believe that You rejoice because I am Your child and I rejoice with You. Please help me to remember this eternal truth. Thank you, Jesus. Amen.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br><br><br></p>

      <title>Taking Down The Tree</title>
      <link>/blogfeed/takingdownthetree</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Scripture</strong> <strong>Verse</strong>:&nbsp; So whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God.&nbsp; 1 Cor. 10:31.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Now that Christmas is over, most of our Christmas trees have been or will be taken down and the ornaments put away for another year.&nbsp; Have you ever wondered why putting up the tree is more fun than taking it down?&nbsp; I have, and I’ve noticed other things as well. For instance, I always enjoy setting the table for a special dinner more than clearing it after the dinner guests have left.&nbsp; And packing for a family vacation is much more compelling and exciting than unpacking.&nbsp; Perhaps the answer lies not so much with our after-Christmas let-down than with facing what comes next – the unspecial, unspectacular return to our normal lives – day to normal day.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Let’s face it, God calls us to be “Everyday Christians” for the majority of our lives, but sometimes hidden there in the ordinary is our true value, our identity, and our unique calling to a life of extraordinary faithfulness, consistency, service, and love. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> When Mary and Martha were blessed with the thrill of hosting our Savior in their own home, what do you imagine they did after He left?&nbsp; They probably cleaned up and did the dishes!&nbsp; After John the Baptist was given the honor of baptizing our Lord in the Jordan River, he no doubt returned to his preaching ministry.&nbsp; In Matthew we read the miraculous account of Christ’s Transfiguration, but what happened next?&nbsp; Jesus came down from the mountain and was immediately met with crowds of people who were seeking Him, and to whom He spoke and ministered.&nbsp; Even the Son of God had his day to day work to do, work to which He was called by the Father!&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What is your day to day work?&nbsp; Where has the Father placed you in this world and what has He given you to do?&nbsp; Whether it seems great or small, average or special, are you performing it with the faithfulness of John the Baptist, the consistency of Mary and Martha, and the love of Christ?&nbsp; While the Christmas mornings and mountaintop experiences can be great blessings in our lives, w<em>ho we truly are</em> can more often be found every day in our homes, offices, churches and schools, where God sees our everyday faithfulness and is pleased.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In Luke 10, there was much rejoicing when Jesus’ disciples returned having ministered to the people with great power and success. But Jesus wisely reminded them that what really mattered is that their names are written down in heaven.&nbsp; Indeed, this is where their true worth and identity was to be found – in belonging to God.&nbsp; Likewise, we are not insignificant, and nothing we do is insignificant as long as we are in Him and are found faithful to Him.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong>:&nbsp; Lord, thank you for calling me to a life of service, for equipping me for that work, and for using me to further your kingdom.&nbsp; I rejoice that you know my name and it is written in heaven.&nbsp; Please help me to be the very best Christian that I can be, serving you and others with a glad and humble heart, whether on the mountains or in the valleys, but mostly in the every days in between.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Today’s Reading</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God’s Word tells us, “No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and He will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation He will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.” (1 Corinthians 10:13, ESV)&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">No matter how seemingly impossible your situation may appear, whether you are battling addiction, depression, anxiety, or stress, know that God always provides a way of escape. If God’s Word tells us there is a way out, expect Him to show up and provide a way for you.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">At an early age, I used drugs to escape a reality that seemed impossible to live sober. I did not listen to what God’s Word said, and as a result, I found myself in a desert for the better part of ten years. It was not until I fully surrendered my life to Christ, and accepted that I could not fix myself, that I began to climb out of the hole I had found myself in. At this point, I yearned to change my life, and wanted to be a better person. I went to a faith-based recovery rehab for one year and had an encounter with God that changed the whole trajectory of my life.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I want you to know if you are struggling with addiction, reach out to someone who loves you and tell them what is going on. There is no shame in admitting you have a problem. We were not created to live in isolation; rather, in community with like-minded people.&nbsp; </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Here at The Point, we offer a group for men in recovery. In this group, you can expect to be heard, be surrounded with people who have been where you are, and ultimately find freedom and break the chains of addiction. James 5 tells us to “Confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed” (James 5:16, ESV).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prayer</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lord Jesus, we thank you for never forsaken us, even in our darkest seasons of life. Thank you for Your Word, and the power it has to break chains and experience freedom. May we have an encounter with you that leaves us forever changed. We give you all the praise, in Jesus name, amen.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> </p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> </p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> </p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> </p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> </p>
